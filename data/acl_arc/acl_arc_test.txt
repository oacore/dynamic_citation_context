Our approach to the crosslanguage retrieval was to translate the English topics into Arabic using online English-Arabic machine translation systems. The four official runs are named as BKYMON, BKYCL1, BKYCL2, and BKYCL3. The BKYMON is the Arabic monolingual run, and the other three runs are English-to-Arabic cross-language runs.

Smith and Eisner, 2006), and parameterized by mixtures of a robust nonlexical syntax/alignment model with a(n optional) lexical-semantics-driven log-linear model. Our model learns soft alignments as a hidden variable in discriminative training. Experimentalresultsusing theTRECdataset are shown to significantly outperform strong state-of-the-art baselines.		This paper presents a syntax-driven approach to question answering, specifically the answer-sentence selection problem for short-answer questions.

We propose a probabilistic quasi-synchronous grammar, inspired by one proposed for machine translation (D.

We make use of log-linear models for computing the paraphrase likelihood between pattern pairs and exploit feature functions based on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), lexical weighting (LW), and monolingual word alignment (MWA). Using the presented method, we extract more than 1 million pairs of paraphrase patterns from about 2 million pairs of bilingual parallel sentences. The precision of the extracted paraphrase patterns is above 78%. Experimental results show that the presented method significantly outperforms a well-known method called discovery of inference rules from text (DIRT). Additionally, the log-linear model with the proposed feature functions are effective. The extracted paraphrase patterns are fully analyzed.

The notion of relevance is taken as the key concept in the theory of information retrieval and a comparative concept of relevance is explicated in terms of the theory of probability. The resulting technique called �Probabilistic Indexing,� allows a computing machine, given a request for information, to make a statistical inference and derive a number (called the �relevance number�) for each document, which is a measure of the probability that the document will satisfy the given request. The result of a search is an ordered list of those documents which satisfy the request ranked according to their probable relevance. The paper goes on to show that whereas in a conventional library system the cross-referencing (�see� and �see also�) is based solely on the �semantical closeness� between index terms, statistical measures of closeness between index terms can be defined and computed. Thus, given an arbitrary request consisting of one (or many) index term(s), a machine can elaborate on it to increase the probability of selecting relevant documents that would not otherwise have been selected. Finally, the paper suggests an interpretation of the whole library problem as one where the request is considered as a clue on the basis of which the library system makes a concatenated statistical inference in order to provide as an output an ordered list of those documents which most probably satisfy the information needs of the user.	This paper reports on a novel technique for literature indexing and searching in a mechanized library system. The notion of relevance is taken as the key concept in the theory of information retrieval and a comparative concept of relevance is explicated in terms of the theory of probability.

As a first step towards addressing this issue, we have been preparing a large bracketed corpus since late 1998. The first two installments of the corpus, 250 thousand words of data, fully segmented, POS-tagged and syntactically bracketed, have been released to the public via LDC (www.ldc.upenn.edu).

We illustrate these methods by estimating a sparse grammar describing the morphology of the Bantu language Sesotho, demonstrating that with suitable priors Bayesian techniques can infer linguistic structure in situations where maximum likelihood methods such as the Inside-Outside algorithm only produce a trivial grammar.

The procedure is based on a very low dimensional representation of the scene, that we term the Spatial Envelope. We propose a set of perceptual dimensions (naturalness, openness, roughness, expansion, ruggedness) that represent the dominant spatial structure of a scene. Then, we show that these dimensions may be reliably estimated using spectral and coarsely localized information. The model generates a multidimensional space in which scenes sharing membership in semantic categories (e.g., streets, highways, coasts) are projected closed together. The performance of the spatial envelope model shows that specific information about object shape or identity is not a requirement for scene categorization and that modeling a holistic representation of the scene informs about its probable semantic category.

This study aims to investigate the long-term predictive value of SSII for all-cause mortality in patients with one- or two-vessel disease undergoing PCI. Methods A total of 628 patients (76% men, mean age: 61+-10 years) undergoing PCI due to stable angina pectoris (43%) or acute coronary syndrome (57%), included between January 2008 and June 2013, were eligible for the current study. SSII was calculated using the original SYNTAX score website (www.syntaxscore.com). Cox regression analysis was used to assess the association between continuous SSII and long-term all-cause mortality. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve was used to assess the performance of SSII. Results SSII ranged from 6.6 to 58.2 (median: 20.4, interquartile range: 16.1-26.8). In multivariable analysis, SSII proved to be an independent significant predictor for 4.5-year mortality (hazard ratio per point increase: 1.10; 95% confidence interval: 1.07-1.13; p<0.001).

These challenges require the design of a robust algorithm that can work under following constraints: (i) low embedding bandwidth, i.e., number of sentences is comparable with message length, (ii) not all transformations can be applied to a given sentence (iii) the number of alternative forms for a sentence is relatively small, a limitation governed by the grammar and vocabulary of the natural language, as well as the requirement to preserve the style and fluency of the document. The adversary can carry out all the transformations used for embedding to remove the embedded message. In addition, the adversary can also permute the sentences, select and use a subset of sentences, and insert new sentences. We give a scheme that overcomes these challenges, together with a partial implementation and its evaluation for the English language. The present application of this scheme works at the sentence level while also using a word-level watermarking technique that was recently designed and built into a fully automatic system (""Equimark""). Unlike Equimark, whose resilience relied on the introduction of ambiguities, the present paper's sentence-level technique is more tuned to situations where very little change to the text is allowable (i.e., when style is important). Secondarily, this paper shows how to use lower-level (in this case word-level) marking to improve the resilience and embedding properties of higher level (in this case sentence level) schemes. We achieve this by using the word-based methods as a separate channel from the sentence-based methods, thereby improving the results of either one alone. The sentence level watermarking technique we introduce is novel and powerful, as it relies on multiple features of each sentence and exploits the notion of orthogonality between features."

This method incrementally finds plausible sequences of utterances that play crucial roles in the task execution of dialogues, and utilizes beam search to deal with the ambiguity of boundaries as well as syntactic and semantic ambiguities.

One useful step is to align the sentences, that is, to identify correspondences between sentences in one language and sentences in the other language.This paper will describe a method and a program (align) for aligning sentences based on a simple statistical model of character lengths.

An evaluation was performed based on a trilingual corpus of economic reports issued by the Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) in English, French, and German. The method correctly aligned all but 4% of the sentences. Moreover, it is possible to extract a large subcorpus that has a much smaller error rate. By selecting the best-scoring 80% of the alignments, the error rate is reduced from 4% to 0.7%. There were more errors on the English-French subcorpus than on the English-German subcorpus, showing that error rates will depend on the corpus considered; however, both were small enough to hope that the method will be useful for many language pairs.To further research on bilingual corpora, a much larger sample of Canadian Hansards (approximately 90 million words, half in English and and half in French) has been aligned with the align program and will be available through the Data Collection Initiative of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL/DCI).

The pattern-based rules describe how abbreviations are formed from definitions. Rules can be generated automatically and/or manually and can be augmented when the system processes new documents.

that previous studies had shown to be intermediate in height (e.g., a pitcher that, while being taller than both cups, was neither short nor tall for a pitcher), and (3) a different type of object to which the adjective is inapplicable (e.g., a door key).', ""Across the different conditions under which the experiment was done (e.g., allowing subjects to study the domain before or after the onset of speech), it was found not to matter much whether the adjective applied 'intrinsically' to the target object (i.e., whether the target was tall for a cup): Hearers identifed the target without problems in both types of situations."", 'The time subjects took before looking at the target for the first time was measured, and although these latency times were somewhat greater when the referent were not intrinsically tall than when they were, the average difference was tiny at 554 versus 538 miliseconds.', 'Since latency times are thought to be sensitive to most of the problems that hearers may have in processing a text, these results suggest that, for dimensional adjectives, it is forgivable to disregard global context.']"	While much work has been done investigating the role of context in the incremental processing of syntactic indeterminacies, relatively little is known about online semantic interpretation. The experiments in this article made use of the eye-tracking paradigm with spoken language and visual contexts in order to examine how, and when listeners make use of contextually-defined contrast in interpreting simple prenominal adjectives. Experiment 1 focused on intersective adjectives. Experiment 1A provided further evidence that intersective adjectives are processed incrementally. Experiment 1B compared response times to follow instructions such as 'Pick up the blue comb' under conditions where there were two blue objects (e.g. a blue pen and a blue comb), but only one of these objects had a contrasting member in the display. Responses were faster to objects with a contrasting member, establishing that the listeners initially assume a contrastive interpretation for intersective adjectives. Experiments 2 and 3 focused on vague scalar adjectives examining the time course with which listeners establish contrast for scalar adjectives such as tall using information provided by the head noun (e.g. glass) and information provided by the visual context. Use of head-based information was examined by manipulating the typicality of the target object (e.g. whether it was a good or poor example of a tall glass. Use of context-dependent contrast was examined by either having only a single glass in the display (the no contrast condition) or a contrasting object (e.g. a smaller glass). The pattern of results indicated that listeners interpreted the scalar adjective incrementally taking into account context-specific contrast prior to encountering the head. Moreover, the presence of a contrasting object, sharply reduced, and in some conditions completely eliminated, typicality effects. The results suggest a language processing system in which semantic interpretation, as well as syntactic processing, is conducted incrementally, with early integration of contextual information.

of Petrov et al. (2006) vary widely in their underlying representations, depending on their EM initialization point. We use this to our advantage, combining multiple automatically learned grammars into an unweighted product model, which gives significantly improved performance over state-of-the-art individual grammars. In our model, the probability of a constituent is estimated as a product of posteriors obtained from multiple grammars that differ only in the random seed used for initialization, without any learning or tuning of combination weights. Despite its simplicity, a product of eight automatically learned grammars improves parsing accuracy from 90.2% to 91.8% on English, and from 80.3% to 84.5% on German.

As basis, the logical setups of Carpenter (1992) and King (1989, 1994) are briefly compared regarding their usefulness as basis for HPSGII (Pollard and Sag 1994). The possibilities for expressing HPSG theories in the HPSGII architecture and in various computational systems (ALE, Troll, CUF, and TFS) are discussed. Beside a formal characterization of the possibilities, the paper investigates the specific choices for constraints with certain linguistic motivations, i.e. the lexicon, structure licencing, and grammatical principles. An ALE implementation of a theory for German proposed by Hinrichs and Nakazawa (1994) is used as example and the ALE grammar is included in the appendix.		The paper presents some aspects involved in the formalization and implementation of HPSG theories. As basis, the logical setups of Carpenter (1992) and King (1989, 1994) are briefly compared regarding their usefulness as basis for HPSGII (Pollard and Sag 1994). The possibilities for expressing HPSG theories in the HPSGII architecture and in various computational systems (ALE, Troll, CUF, and TFS) are discussed. Beside a formal characterization of the possibilities, the paper investigates the specific choices for constraints with certain linguistic motivations, i.e. the lexicon, structure licencing, and grammatical principles. An ALE implementation of a theory for German proposed by Hinrichs and Nakazawa (1994) is used as example and the ALE grammar is included in the appendix.

Automatic text categorization, the process of assigning unseen documents to user-defined categories, is an important task that can help in the organization and querying of such collections. In this article we consider the problem of classifying online papers from a specific journal in the geological sciences, over a set of expert defined categories. We evaluate two general strategies and several variants thereof. The first strategy is based on Naive Bayes, a popular text classification algorithm. The second strategy is based on Principle Direction Divisive Partitioning, an unsupervised document clustering algorithm. While the performance of both approaches is quite good, some of the new variants that we propose including one, which involves a combination of these two approaches yield even better results.		In recent years we have seen a tremendous growth in the number of text document collections available on the Internet. Automatic text categorization, the process of assigning unseen documents to user-defined categories, is an important task that can help in the organization and querying of such collections. In this article we consider the problem of classifying online papers from a specific journal in the geological sciences, over a set of expert defined categories. We evaluate two general strategies and several variants thereof. The first strategy is based on Naive Bayes, a popular text classification algorithm. The second strategy is based on Principle Direction Divisive Partitioning, an unsupervised document clustering algorithm. While the performance of both approaches is quite good, some of the new variants that we propose including one, which involves a combination of these two approaches yield even better results.

Our approach leverages the vast resource of pictures available on the web and the fact that many of them are captioned. Inspired by recent work in summarization, we propose extractive and abstractive caption generation models. They both operate over the output of a probabilistic image annotation model that pre-processes the pictures and suggests keywords to describe their content.

However, sentiment is expressed differently in different domains, and annotating corpora for every possible domain of interest is impractical. We investigate domain adaptation for sentiment classifiers, focusing on online reviews for different types of products. First, we extend to sentiment classification the recently-proposed structural correspondence learning (SCL) algorithm, reducing the relative error due to adaptation between domains by an average of 30% over the original SCL algorithm and 46% over a supervised baseline. Second, we identify a measure of domain similarity that correlates well with the potential for adaptation of a classifier from one domain to another. This measure could for instance be used to select a small set of domains to annotate whose trained classifiers would transfer well to many other domains.

With lexical decision and naming tasks, repetition priming and contiguous priming procedures, and masked and unmasked prime presentation, a pattern of results emerged with qualitative differences between the effects of morphological and form relatedness. With lexical decision, mere orthographic similarity between primes and targets (e.g., keller-KELLER, cellar-ladle) produced negative effects, whereas morphological relatedness (e.g., kellen-KELLE, ladles-ladle) consistently resulted in facilitation. With the naming task, positive priming effects were found for morphological as well as for mere form similarity. On the basis of these results, a model of the lexicon is proposed in which information about word form is represented separately from morphological structure and in which processing at the form level is characterized in terms of activation of, and competition between, form-related entries.

Theories generally propose that lexical semantics are learned either through perceptual experience or through exposure to regularities in language. We propose here a model to integrate these two information sources. Specifically, the model uses the global structure of memory to exploit the redundancy between language and perception in order to generate inferred perceptual representations for words with which the model has no perceptual experience. We test the model on a variety of different datasets from grounded cognition experiments and demonstrate that this diverse set of results can be explained as perceptual simulation (cf.

Despite their success, these methods compromise the probabilistic  interpretation of the underlying model thus limiting the application of probabilistically  defined decision rules during training and decoding.  As an alternative, in this thesis, we propose a novel Monte Carlo sampling approach  for theoretically sound approximate probabilistic inference within these models. The  distribution we are interested in is the conditional distribution of a log-linear translation  model; however, often, there is no tractable way of computing the normalisation term  of the model. Instead, a Gibbs sampling approach for phrase-based machine translation  models is developed which obviates the need of computing this term yet produces  samples from the required distribution.  We establish that the sampler effectively explores the distribution defined by a  phrase-based models by showing that it converges in a reasonable amount of time to  the desired distribution, irrespective of initialisation. Empirical evidence is provided to  confirm that the sampler can provide accurate estimates of expectations of functions of  interest. The mix of high probability and low probability derivations obtained through  sampling is shown to provide a more accurate estimate of expectations than merely  using the n-most highly probable derivations.  Subsequently, we show that the sampler provides a tractable solution for finding the  maximum probability translation in the model. We also present a unified approach to  approximating two additional intractable problems: minimum risk training and minimum  Bayes risk decoding. Key to our approach is the use of the sampler which  allows us to explore the entire probability distribution and maintain a strict probabilistic  formulation through the translation pipeline. For these tasks, sampling allies  the simplicity of n-best list approaches with the extended view of the distribution that  lattice-based approaches benefit from, while avoiding the biases associated with beam  search. Our approach is theoretically well-motivated and can give better and more  stable results than current state of the art methods		Recent advances in statistical machine translation (SMT) have used dynamic programming  (DP) based beam search methods for approximate inference within probabilistic  translation models. Despite their success, these methods compromise the probabilistic  interpretation of the underlying model thus limiting the application of probabilistically  defined decision rules during training and decoding.  As an alternative, in this thesis, we propose a novel Monte Carlo sampling approach  for theoretically sound approximate probabilistic inference within these models. The  distribution we are interested in is the conditional distribution of a log-linear translation  model; however, often, there is no tractable way of computing the normalisation term  of the model. Instead, a Gibbs sampling approach for phrase-based machine translation  models is developed which obviates the need of computing this term yet produces  samples from the required distribution.

The parser now produces an intermediate semantic frame representation, which serves as the focal point for all back-end operations, such as history management, text generation, and SQL query generation.

We have also improved the display of the database table, making it considerably easier for a subject to comprehend the information given.

In this paper, EUROPA, a new framework for developing spoken dialogue systems, is introduced. In developing EUROPA, the authors focused on three points : (1) acceptance of spoken language, (2) portability in terms of domain and task, and (3) practical performance of the applied system. The framework is applied to prototyping a car navigation system called MINOS. MINOS is built on a portable PC, can process over 700 words of recognition vocabulary, and is able to respond to a user's question within a few seconds.

In this article, the CR framework is then used to systematically investigate three fundamental questions concerning distributional similarity. First, is the relationship of lexical similarity necessarily symmetric, or are there advantages to be gained from considering it as an asymmetric relationship? Second, are some co-occurrences inherently more salient than others in the calculation of distributional similarity? Third, is it necessary to consider the difference in the extent to which each word occurs in each co-occurrence type? Two application-based tasks are used for evaluation: automatic thesaurus generation and pseudo-disambiguation. It is possible to achieve significantly better results on both these tasks by varying the parameters within the CR framework rather than using other existing distributional similarity measures; it will also be shown that any single unparameterized measure is unlikely to be able to do better on both tasks. This is due to an inherent asymmetry in lexical substitutability and therefore also in lexical distributional similarity.

The method does not change the meaning of the source text; it only replaces some words by their synonyms. Groups of absolute synonyms are used in a context independent manner, while the groups of relative synonyms are previously tested for semantic compatibility with the collocations containing the word to be replaced. A specific replacement is determined by the hidden information. The collocations are syntactically connected and semantically compatible pairs of content words; they are massively gathered beforehand, with a wide diversity in their stability and idiomacity. Thus the necessary linguistic resources are a specific synonymy dictionary and a very large database of collocations. The steganographic algorithm is informally outlined.

The base parser produces a set of candidate parses for each input sentence, with associated probabilities that define an initial ranking of these parses. A second model then attempts to improve upon this initial ranking, using additional features of the tree as evidence. The strength of our approach is that it allows a tree to be represented as an arbitrary set of features, without concerns about how these features interact or overlap and without the need to define a derivation or a generative model which takes these features into account. We introduce a new method for the reranking task, based on the boosting approach to ranking problems described in Freund et al. (1998). We apply the boosting method to parsing the Wall Street Journal treebank. The method combined the log-likelihood under a baseline model (that of Collins [1999]) with evidence from an additional 500,000 features over parse trees that were not included in the original model. The new model achieved 89.75 % F-measure, a 13 % relative decrease in F-measure error over the baseline model's score of 88.2%. The article also introduces a new algorithm for the boosting approach which takes advantage of the sparsity of the feature space in the parsing data. Experiments show significant efficiency gains for the new algorithm over the obvious implementation of the boosting approach. We argue that the method is an appealing alternative--in terms of both simplicity and efficiency--to work on feature selection methods within log-linear (maximum-entropy) models. Although the experiments in this article are on natural language parsing (NLP), the approach should be applicable to many other NLP problems which are naturally framed as ranking tasks, for example, speech recognition, machine translation, or natural language generation		This article considers approaches which rerank the output of an existing probabilistic parser.

Using computer vision techniques, we build visual and multimodal distributional models and compare them to standard textual models. Our results show that, while visual models with state-of-the-art computer vision techniques perform worse than textual models in general tasks (accounting for semantic relatedness), they are as good or better models of the meaning of words with visual correlates such as color terms, even in a nontrivial task that involves nonliteral uses of such words. Moreover, we show that visual and textual information are tapping on different aspects of meaning, and indeed combining them in multimodal models often improves performance.

We present a new method for computing semantic relatedness of concepts. The method relies solely on the structure of a conceptual network and eliminates the need for performing additional corpus analysis. The network structure is employed to generate artificial conceptual glosses. They replace textual definitions proper written by humans and are processed by a dictionary based metric of semantic relatedness [1]. We implemented the metric on the basis of GermaNet, the German counterpart of WordNet, and evaluated the results on a German dataset of 57 word pairs rated by human subjects for their semantic relatedness. Our approach can be easily applied to compute semantic relatedness based on alternative conceptual networks, e.g. in the domain of life sciences.		Abstract.

Traditional deterministic parsing algorithms are based on a shift-reduce framework: they traverse the sentence from left-to-right and, at each step, perform one of a possible set of actions, until a complete tree is built. A drawback of this approach is that it is extremely local: while decisions can be based on complex structures on the left, they can look only at a few words to the right. In contrast, our algorithm builds a dependency tree by iteratively selecting the best pair of neighbours to connect at each parsing step. This allows incorporation of features from already built structures both to the left and to the right of the attachment point. The parser learns both the attachment preferences and the order in which they should be performed. The result is a deterministic, best-first, O(nlogn) parser, which is significantly more accurate than best-first transition based parsers, and nears the performance of globally optimized parsing models.

Even the country's growing cultural and religious diversity is not at odds with its degree of togetherness. Yet, there are clear indications of potential threats: for example, the generally perceived lack of social justice and the gaping cleavage in togetherness between east and west as well as between structurally weak regions and such that are flourishing. To that end, cohesion is much weaker in Germany's eastern federal states than its western ones. The federal states with the highest levels of cohesion are Saarland, Baden-Wurttemberg, and Bavaria. These are the core findings from the Social Cohesion Radar (SCR), for which Bertelsmann Stiftung collected fresh data in 2017 by surveying more than 5,000 people throughout the country. The goal was to examine cohesion in terms of its strengths, weaknesses, causes, and effects. For this empirical study, social cohesion is defined as the quality of communal life and is viewed as a multidimensional phenomenon. High levels of cohesion result from strong social relations, a positive feeling of connectedness to the community, and a strong focus on the common good		Despite all the dire predictions, Germany continues to exhibit a high level of social cohesion. Even the country's growing cultural and religious diversity is not at odds with its degree of togetherness. Yet, there are clear indications of potential threats: for example, the generally perceived lack of social justice and the gaping cleavage in togetherness between east and west as well as between structurally weak regions and such that are flourishing. To that end, cohesion is much weaker in Germany's eastern federal states than its western ones. The federal states with the highest levels of cohesion are Saarland, Baden-Wurttemberg, and Bavaria. These are the core findings from the Social Cohesion Radar (SCR), for which Bertelsmann Stiftung collected fresh data in 2017 by surveying more than 5,000 people throughout the country. The goal was to examine cohesion in terms of its strengths, weaknesses, causes, and effects. For this empirical study, social cohesion is defined as the quality of communal life and is viewed as a multidimensional phenomenon.

In the final evaluation, MaltParser was ranked second among the participating systems and achieved an unlabeled attachment score close to 90% for Bangla and Hindi, and over 85% for Telugu, while the labeled attachment score was 15-25 percentage points lower. It is likely that the high unlabeled accuracy is achieved thanks to a relatively low syntactic complexity in the data sets, while the low labeled accuracy is due to the limited amounts of training data.

grammar (TAG) formalism. The grammar uses a TAG that is both lexicalized (Schabes, Abeille, Joshi 1988) and feature-based (VijayShankar, Joshi 1988). In this paper, we describe a wide range of phenomena that it covers. A Lexicalized TAG (LTAG) is organized around a lexicon, which associates sets of elementary trees (instead of just simple categories) with the lexical items. A Lexicalized TAG consists of a finite set of trees associated with lexical items, and operations (adjunction and substitution) for composing the trees. A lexical item is called the anchor of its corresponding tree and directly determines both the tree's structure and its syntactic features. In particular, the trees define the domain of locality over which constraints are specified and these constraints are local with respect to their anchor. In this paper, the basic tree structures of the English LTAG are described, along with some relevant features. The interaction between the morphological and the syntactic components of the lexicon is also explained. Next, the properties of the different tree structures are discussed. The use of S complements exclusively allows us to take full advantage of the treatment of unbounded dependencies originally presented in Joshi (1985) and Kroch and Joshi (1985). Structures for auxiliaries and raising-verbs which use adjunction trees are also discussed. We present a representation of prepositional complements that is based on extended elementary trees. This representation avoids the need for preposition incorporation in order to account for double whquestions (preposition stranding and pied-piping) and the pseudo-passive. A treatment of light verb constructions is also given, similar to what Abeille (1988c) has presented. Again, neither noun nor adjective incorporation is needed to handle double passives and to account for CNPC violations in these constructions. TAG'S extended domain of locality allows us to handle, within a single level of syntactic description, phenomena that in other frameworks require either dual analyses or reanalysis. In addition, following Abeille and Schabes (1989), we describe how to deal with semantic non compositionality in verb-particle combinations, light verb constructions and idioms, without losing the internal syntactic composition of these structures.

The backbone of our system is a traditional retrieval engine which builds inverted index files from pre-processed docu- ments, and then searches and ranks the documents in response to user queries. Natural language processing is used to (1) preprocess the documents in order to extract contents-carrying terms, (2) discover interterm dependencies and build a conceptual hierarchy specific to the database domain, and (3) process user&apos;s natural language requests into effective search queries. The basic assumption of this design is that term-based representation of contents is in principle sufficient to build an effective if not optimal search query out of any users request. This has been confirmed by an experiment that compared effectiveness of expert-user prepared queries with those derived automatically from an initial narrative information request. In this paper we show that largescale natural language processing (hundreds of millions of words and more) is not only required for a better retrieval, but it is also doable, given appropriate resources.

We show that L 3 M admits efficient inference and can be augmented with knowledge-based constraints; we also present a fast stochastic gradient based learning. Experiments on ACE and Ontonotes data show that L 3 M and its constrained version, CL 3 M, are more accurate than several state-of-the-art approaches as well as some structured prediction models proposed in the literature.

In this paper, we describe a methodology for interpreting linguistic structures that encode hypernymic propositions, in which a more specific concept is in a taxonomic relationship with a more general concept. In order to effectively process these constructions, we exploit underspecified syntactic analysis and structured domain knowledge from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). After introducing the syntactic processing on which our system depends, we focus on the UMLS knowledge that supports interpretation of hypernymic propositions. We first use semantic groups from the Semantic Network to ensure that the two concepts involved are compatible; hierarchical information in the Metathesaurus then determines which concept is more general and which more specific. A preliminary evaluation of a sample based on the semantic group Chemicals and Drugs provides 83% precision. An error analysis was conducted and potential solutions to the problems encountered are presented. The research discussed here serves as a paradigm for investigating the interaction between domain knowledge and linguistic structure in natural language processing, and could also make a contribution to research on automatic processing of discourse structure. Additional implications of the system we present include its integration in advanced semantic interpretation processors for biomedical text and its use for information extraction in specific domains. The approach has the potential to support a range of applications, including information retrieval and ontology engineering.

The grammar uses a TAG that is both lexicalized (Schabes, Abeille, Joshi 1988) and feature-based (VijayShankar, Joshi 1988). In this paper, we describe a wide range of phenomena that it covers. A Lexicalized TAG (LTAG) is organized around a lexicon, which associates sets of elementary trees (instead of just simple categories) with the lexical items. A Lexicalized TAG consists of a finite set of trees associated with lexical items, and operations (adjunction and substitution) for composing the trees. A lexical item is called the anchor of its corresponding tree and directly determines both the tree's structure and its syntactic features. In particular, the trees define the domain of locality over which constraints are specified and these constraints are local with respect to their anchor. In this paper, the basic tree structures of the English LTAG are described, along with some relevant features. The interaction between the morphological and the syntactic components of the lexicon is also explained. Next, the properties of the different tree structures are discussed. The use of S complements exclusively allows us to take full advantage of the treatment of unbounded dependencies originally presented in Joshi (1985) and Kroch and Joshi (1985). Structures for auxiliaries and raising-verbs which use adjunction trees are also discussed. We present a representation of prepositional complements that is based on extended elementary trees. This representation avoids the need for preposition incorporation in order to account for double whquestions (preposition stranding and pied-piping) and the pseudo-passive. A treatment of light verb constructions is also given, similar to what Abeille (1988c) has presented. Again, neither noun nor adjective incorporation is needed to handle double passives and to account for CNPC violations in these constructions. TAG'S extended domain of locality allows us to handle, within a single level of syntactic description, phenomena that in other frameworks require either dual analyses or reanalysis. In addition, following Abeille and Schabes (1989), we describe how to deal with semantic non compositionality in verb-particle combinations, light verb constructions and idioms, without losing the internal syntactic composition of these structures.

information of recognized terms unlike machine learning based approaches. However, dictionary based approaches have two serious problems: (1) a large number of false recognitions mainly caused by short names. (2) low recall due to spelling variation. In this paper, we tackle the former problem by using a machine learning method to filter out false positives. We also present an approximate string searching method to alleviate the latter problem. Experimental results using the GE-NIA corpus show that the filtering using a naive Bayes classifier greatly improves precision with slight loss of recall, resulting in a much better F-score.

The algorithm clearly does not work in all cases, but the results of an examination of several hundred examples from published texts show that it performs remarkably well. In the second approach, it is shown how pronoun solution can be handled in a comprehensive system for semantic analysis of English texts.

We argue that the feature-based foundation is both more economical and expressively more powerful than non-feature-based systems. It is more economical because it employs only mechanisms already assumed to be present elsewhere in the grammar (viz., in the feature system), and it is more expressive because feature systems are more expressive than other mechanisms used in expressing lexical inheritance (cf. DATR). The lexicon furthermore allows the use of default unification, based on the ideas of default unification, defined by Bouma.

Our discussion of derivation is more programmatic; but here, too, we argue that feature structures of a suitably rich sort provide a foundation for the definition of lexical rules.

method for the automatic acquisition of the hyponymy lexical relation from unrestricted text. Two goals motivate the approach: (i) avoidance of the need for pre-encoded knowledge and (ii) applicability across a wide range of text. We identify a set of lexico-syntactic patterns that are easily recognizable, that occur frequently and across text genre boundaries, and that indisputably indicate the lexical relation of interest. We describe a method for discovering these patterns and suggest that other lexical relations will also be acquirable in this way. A subset of the acquisition algorithm is implemented and the results are used to augment and critique the structure of a large hand-built thesaurus. Extensions and applications to areas such as information retrieval are suggested. 1 Introduction  Currently there is much interest in the automatic acquisition of lexical syntax and semantics, with the goal of building up large lexicons for natural language processing.

When used to evaluate a system that performs reordering as a preprocessing step our framework allows the parser and reordering rules to be evaluated extremely quickly without time-consuming end-to-end machine translation experiments.

descriptive coverage, adequacy of the representation, and the computational usefulness of representations. In addressing these issues, I will discuss what I think are some of the central problems facing the lexical semantics community, and suggest ways of best approaching these issues. Then, I will provide a method for the decomposition of lexical categories and outline a theory of lexical semantics embodying a notion of cocompositionality and type coercion, as well as several levels of semantic description, where the semantic load is spread more evenly throughout the lexicon. I argue that lexical decomposition is possible if it is performed generatively. Rather than assuming a fixed set of primitives. I will assume a fixed number of generative devices that can be seen as constructing semantic expressions. I develop a theory of Qualia Structure, a representation language for lexical items, which renders much lexical ambiguity in the lexicon unnecessary, while still explaining the systematic polysemy that words carry. Finally, I discuss how individual lexical structures can be integrated into the larger lexical knowledge base through a theory of lexical inheritance. This provides us with the necessary principles of global organization for the lexicon, enabling us to fully integrate our natural language lexicon into a conceptual whole.

Compared to the built-in morphological feature set, ours is both much smaller and more accurate across a sample of 20 morphologically annotated treebanks. We find increases in accuracy of up to 5.3% absolute. While some of this results from the feature set capturing information unrelated to morphology, there is still significant improvement, up to 4.6% absolute, due to the agreement model.

In contrast, this paper describes a new approach toward using contextual, dialog-based knowledge for speech recognition. To demonstrate this approach, we have built MINDS, a system which uses contextual knowledge to predictively generate expectations about the conceptual content that may be expressed in a system user's next utterance. These expectations are expanded to constrain the possible words which may be matched from an incoming speech signal. To prevent system rigidity and allow for diverse user behavior, the system creates layered predictions which range from very specific to very general. Each time new information becomes available from the ongoing dialog, MINDS generates a different set of layered predictions for processing the next utterance. The predictions contain constraints derived from the contextual, dialog level knowledge sources and each prediction is translated into a grammar usable by our speech recognizer, SPHINX. Since speech recognizers use grammars to dictate legal word sequences and to constrain the recognition process, the dynamically generated grammars reduce the number of word candidates considered by the recognizer. The results demonstrate that speech recognition accuracy is greatly enhanced through the use of predictions.

First we argue that the written language notion of the word has had too much impact on models of spoken word recognition. Next we discuss various characteristics of prosodic structure that bear on processing issues. Then we present a view of continuous word recognition which takes into account the alternating pattern of weak and strong syllables in the speech stream. A lexical search is conducted with the stressed syllables while the weak syllables are identified through a pattern-recognition-like analysis and the use of phonotactic and morphonemic rules. We end by discussing the content word vs. function word access controversy in the light of our view.

`derived' / `alternant' semi-productive, and therefore only semipredictable, bounded dependency constructions, such as particle or dative movement, there are at least 163 valency frames associated with verbal predicates in (current) English (Briscoe, 2000). In this paper, I will review the work that my colleagues and I have done to learn (semi-)automatically this very large number of associations between individual verbal predicates and valency frames. Access to a comprehensive and accurate valency lexicon is critical for the development of robust and accurate parsing technology capable of recovering predicate-argument relations (and thus logical forms) from free text or transcribed speech. Without this information it is possible to `chunk' input into phrases but not to distinguish arguments from adjuncts or resolve most phrasal attachment ambiguities. Furthermore, for statistical parsers it is not enough to know the associations of predicates to valency frames, it is also critical to know the relative frequency of such associations given a specific predicate. Such information is a core component of that required to `lexicalize' a probabilistic parser, and it is now well-established that lexicalization is essential for accurate disambiguation (e.g. Collins, 1997, Carroll et al, 1998). While state-of-the-art wide-coverage grammars of English, capable of recovering predicateargument structure and expressed as a unification-based phrase structure grammar, have on the order of 1000 rules, it is clear that the number of associations between valency frames and predicates needed in a lexicon for such a grammar will be much higher.		ing over specific lexically-governed particles and prepositions and specific predicate selectional preferences, but including some `derived' / `alternant' semi-productive, and therefore only semipredictable, bounded dependency constructions, such as particle or dative movement, there are at least 163 valency frames associated with verbal predicates in (current) English (Briscoe, 2000).

Interpretation of nominalizations involves three tasks: deciding whether the nominalization is being used in a verbal or non-verbal sense; disambiguating the nominalized verb when a verbal sense is used; and determining the fillers of the thematic roles of the verbal concept or predicate of the nominalization. A verbal sense can be recognized by the presence of modifiers that represent the arguments of the verbal concept. It is these same modifiers which provide the semantic clues to disambiguate the nominalized verb. In the absence of explicit modifiers, heuristics are used to discriminate between verbal and nonverbal senses.

It combines a lexical taxonomy structure with corpus statistical information so that the semantic distance between nodes in the semantic space constructed by the taxonomy can be better quantified with the computational evidence derived from a distributional analysis of corpus data. Specifically, the proposed measure is a combined approach that inherits the edge-based approach of the edge counting scheme, which is then enhanced by the node-based approach of the information content calculation. When tested on a common data set of word pair similarity ratings, the proposed approach outperforms other computational models. It gives the highest correlation value (r = 0.828) with a benchmark based on human similarity judgements, whereas an upper bound (r = 0.885) is observed when human subjects replicate the same task.

These are denoted as experiential data and distributional data. Experiential data are derived by way of experience with the physical world and comprise the sensory-motor data obtained through sense receptors. Distributional data, by contrast, describe the statistical distribution of words across spoken and written language. The authors claim that experiential and distributional data represent distinct data types and that each is a nontrivial source of semantic information. Their theoretical proposal is that human semantic representations are derived from an optimal statistical combination of these 2 data types. Using a Bayesian probabilistic model, they demonstrate how word meanings can be learned by treating experiential and distributional data as a single joint distribution and learning the statistical structure that underlies it. The semantic representations that are learned in this manner are measurably more realistic-as verified by comparison to a set of human-based measures of semantic representation-than those available from either data type individually or from both sources independently. This is not a result of merely using quantitatively more data, but rather it is because experiential and distributional data are qualitatively distinct, yet intercorrelated, types of data. The semantic representations that are learned are based on statistical structures that exist both within and between the experiential and distributional data types.Copyright (c) 2009 APA, all rights reserved.
