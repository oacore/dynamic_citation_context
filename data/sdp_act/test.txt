CCT1	81153632	"Two steps back, one step forward: reconstructing the dynamic Danube riverscape under human influence in Vienna"	Severin Hohensinner	The English Village Community Examined in its Relation to the Manorial and Tribal Systems and to the Common or Open Field System of Husbandry	"[""Frederic Seebohm""]"	"The Yorkshire-born barrister, banker and economic historian Frederic Seebohm (1833Ð1912) first came to attention with his work on the Reformation intellectuals Colet, Erasmus and More. In this work, first published and then reissued in 1883, Seebohm's focus is on the agrarian history of medieval England, with special reference to problems of early land tenure and the social system that developed from it. Seebohm stresses the continuity between Roman settlement and English villages, and he regards the manor, whose lands were cultivated by serfs, as the original form of landed property among the Anglo-Saxons and other Germanic peoples. He was the first British historian to provide a detailed description of the structure and economic life of the large manor, based on the unpaid labour of the serfs, and of the relations between the manor and the community. The book remains an influential treatment of the feudal system."

Foresman"", ""Steward T. A. Pickett"", ""Wayne C.

This paper presents three principal methods: (1) core analysis; (2) historic mapping; and (3) gradient analysis, to link spatial and temporal data for urban ecosystems and applies their use in the Baltimore-Chesapeake region. Paleoecological evidence derived from the geochronology of sediment cores provides data on long-term as well as recent changes in vegetative land cover. This information, combined with contemporary vegetation maps, provides a baseline for conducting trend analyses to evaluate urbanization of the landscape. A 200-year historical land use database created from historical maps, census data, and remotely sensed data provides a spatial framework for investigating human impacts on the region. A geographic information system (GIS) integrates core analyses with historic data on land use change to yield a comprehensive land use and land cover framework and rates of change. These data resources establish the regional foundation for investigating the ecological components of an urban ecosystem. Urban-rural gradient analyses and patch analyses are proposed as the most appropriate methods for studying the urban ecosystem as they link ecological and social patterns and processes for varying degrees of urbanization."

M. Gurnell"", ""S. R. Downward"", ""R. Jones""]"	"Channel planform change was investigated along an 18 km section of the River Dee on the Welsh-English border by overlaying information from historical maps and air photographs. The information on river planform change spans the last 115 years, during which time the river has been subject to increasing flow regulation, which may have affected its planform. The downstream location of the reach provides two additional factors which may have an impact on the nature and rate of planform change through their influence on energy conditions in the reach: a tidal backwater influence on the downstream section of the reach; and a low angle of slope. The reach has shown very small changes in planform over the last 115 years, which have been successfully identified by a geographical information system (GIS)-based data handling methodology, which not only allows the estimation of a variety of indices of change, but also supports the estimation of the potential errors associated with registering the historical sources to a common base and digitizing the channel boundary locations. The study is successful in identifying channel planform change because it has utilized a GIS-based as opposed to a manual approach, but it represents the lower limit to which bank movement can be confidently identified in a low-power river environment from 1:10000 scale sources. The changes identified by the GIS-based methodology include a decrease in channel mobility in a downstream direction; a predominantly oscillatory movement pattern in locations where channel movement has occurred; and an apparent propagation of a decrease in channel width downstream through the reach during the period since 1949, which is the main period of increasing flow regulation."

These periods were strongly intertwined with both the history of the river and the history of the city. Urban expansion into the floodplains is demonstrated in this paper by investigating the island Unterer Werd, next to the city centre. In the late 17th century the fluvial dynamic still hampered urban development on the island. First measures to stabilise the river banks and to protect buildings from floods were taken soon thereafter, but the majority of practices aimed at mitigating the risks and impacts of the frequent floods: inundation was a part of the arrangement and the main target was to minimise the potential impacts. This practice also prevailed after the 1830s, when urban expansion began to move into the north and northwest of the island and the Danube floodplains were considered an important land resource for the growing city. In connection with new technologies and available means to channelise the river, the relationship between Vienna and the Danube changed fundamentally. Urban development in the riverine landscape gained new momentum. This process was initiated before the Great Danube Regulation from 1870 to 1875 was completed, the rate of growth accelerated after 1875. The last decades of the 19th century mark a turning point in the urban development of Vienna, with expanding urban areas becoming dependent upon a well functioning and maintained flood protection system."

Concerning the Little Ice Age the conception of witchcraft is of enormous importance. Weather-making counts among the traditional abilities of witches. During the late 14th and 15th centuries the traditional conception of witchcraft was transformed into the idea of a great conspiracy of witches, to explain ""unnatural"" climatic phenomena. Because of their dangerous nature, particularly their ability to generate hailstorms, the very idea of witches was the subject of controversial discussion around 1500. The beginnings of meteorology and its emphasis of ""natural"" reasons in relationship to the development of weather must be seen against the background of this demoniacal discussion. The resurgence of the Little Ice Age revealed the susceptibility of society. Scapegoat reactions may be observed by the early 1560s even though climatologists, thus far, have been of the opinion that the cooling period did not begin until 1565. Despite attempts of containment, such as the calvinistic doctrine of predestination, extended witch-hunts took place at the various peaks of the Little Ice Age because a part of society held the witches directly responsible for the high frequency of climatic anomalies and the impacts thereof. The enormous tensions created in society as a result of the persecution of witches demonstrate how dangerous it is to discuss climatic change under the aspects of morality."

Terwee"", ""Dirk L. Knol"", ""Lex M. Bouter""]"	"Background: Reproducibility concerns the degree to which repeated measurements provide similar results. Agreement parameters assess how close the results of the repeated measurements are, by estimating the measurement error in repeated measurements. Reliability parameters assess whether study objects, often persons, can be distinguished from each other, despite measurement errors. In that case, the measurement error is related to the variability between persons. Consequently, reliability parameters are highly dependent on the heterogeneity of the study sample, while the agreement parameters, based on measurement error, are more a pure characteristic of the measurement instrument. Methods and Results: Using an example of an interrater study, in which different physical therapists measure the range of motion of the arm in patients with shoulder complaints, the differences and relationships between reliability and agreement parameters for continuous variables are illustrated. Conclusion: If the research question concerns the distinction of persons, reliability parameters are the most appropriate. But if the aim is to measure change in health status, which is often the case in clinical practice, parameters of agreement are preferred. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

In collective decisions, however, only certain group members may have the opportunity to compare options.

We used radio-frequency identification-tagged ants to monitor individual behaviour. Here we show for the first time that switching between nests during the decision process can influence nest choice without requiring direct comparison of nests. Ants finding the poor nest were likely to switch and find the good nest, whereas ants finding the good nest were more likely to stay committed to that nest. When ants switched quickly between the two nests, colonies chose the good nest. Switching by ants that had the opportunity to compare nests had little effect on nest choice. We suggest a new mechanism of collective nest choice: individuals respond to nest quality by the decision either to commit or to seek alternatives.

Social insect colonies possess remarkable abilities to select the best among several courses of action. In populous societies with highly efficient recruitment behaviour, decision-making is distributed across many individuals, each acting on limited local information with appropriate decision rules. To investigate the degree to which small societies with less efficient recruitment can also employ distributed decision-making, we studied nest site selection in Leptothorax albipennis. Colonies were found to make sophisticated choices, taking into account not only the intrinsic qualities of each site, but also its value relative to the available options. In choices between two sites, individual ants were able to visit both sites, compare them and choose the better one. However, most ants encountered only one site in the course of an emigration. These poorly informed ants also contributed to the colony's decision, because their probability of initiating recruitment to a site depended on its quality. This led to shorter latencies between discovery and recruitment to a superior site, and so created greater amplification via positive feedback of the population at the better site. In short, these small colonies make use of a distributed mechanism of information processing, but also take advantage of direct decision-making by well-informed individuals. The latter feature may in part stem from the limitations of their social structure, but may also reflect the stringent demand for unanimous decisions by house-hunting colonies of any size."

CCT18	5225915	A Simple Threshold Rule Is Sufficient to Explain Sophisticated Collective Decision-Making	Elva Robinson	Emergence of group rationality from irrational individuals	"[""T. Sasaki"", ""S. C. Pratt""]"	"Evolutionary theory predicts that animal decision makers should be rational, meaning that they consistently choose fitness-maximizing options. Despite this, violations of rationality have been found repeatedly in humans and other animals. The significance of these violations remains controversial, but many explanations point to cognitive limitations that prevent animals from adequately processing the information needed for fully rational choice. Instead, they rely on heuristics that usually work well but yield systematic errors in specific contexts. Although past research on rationality has focused on individuals, many highly integrated groups, such as ant colonies, regularly make consensus choices among food sources, nest sites, or other options. These collective choices emerge from local interactions among many group members, none of whom take on the whole burden of decision making. We hypothesized that groups may evade the irrational consequences of individual limitations by distributing their decision making across many group members. We tested this in the well-studied case of collective nest-site selection by Temnothorax ants. We found that individual ants, but not colonies, strongly violated rationality when presented with a challenging nest-site choice. Specifically, isolated individuals irrationally switched their preference between 2 alternative nest sites based on their experience of an unattractive decoy. Given the same choice, intact colonies maintained consistent preferences regardless of the decoy's presence. Previous studies have stressed how distributed decision making can filter out random errors made by group members. Our results show that collectives can also suppress systematic errors that emerge from the decision heuristics of cognitively limited individuals. Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press."

Pratt"", ""David J.T. Sumpter"", ""Eamonn B. Mallon"", ""Nigel R. Franks""]"	"Colonies of the ant Temnothorax (formerly Leptothorax) albipennis can collectively choose the best of several nest sites, even when many of the active ants who organize the move visit only one site. Previous studies have suggested that this ability stems from the ants' strategy of graded commitment to a potential home. On finding a site, an ant proceeds from independent assessment, to recruiting fellow active ants via slow tandem runs, to bringing the passive bulk of the colony via rapid transports. Assessment duration varies inversely with site quality, and the switch from tandem runs to transports requires that a quorum of ants first be summoned to the site. These rules may generate a collective decision, by creating and amplifying differential population growth rates among sites. We test the importance of these and other known behavioural rules by incorporating them into an agent-based model. All parameters governing individual behaviour were estimated from videotaped emigrations of individually marked ants given a single nest option of either good or mediocre quality. The time course of simulated emigrations and the distribution of behaviour across ants largely matched these observations, except for the speed with which the final transport phase was completed, and the overall emigration speed of one particularly large colony. The model also predicted the prevalence of splitting between sites when colonies had to choose between two sites of different quality, although it correctly predicted the degree of splitting in only four of six cases. It did not fully capture variance in colony performance, but it did predict the emergence of variation in individual behaviour, despite the use of identical parameter values for all ants. The model shows how, with adequate empirical data, the algorithmic form of a collective decision-making mechanism can be captured."

The colonies ranked these attributes: darkness of the nest site was more important than internal cavity height, which in turn was more important than entrance width. These choices conform to the logic of transitivity. In addition, the colonies used a sophisticated decision-making strategy in which they took all alternatives and all attributes into consideration. Furthermore, the ants, in effect, weighed the different values of different attributes. They also chose the best nest when presented with only one excellent nest among four mediocre ones or one excellent nest in an array of one excellent, one good and one mediocre.

One hundred seventy-two years after DarwinÕs wedding, we reconsider whether this process of choice, under which individuals assign values to their options and compare their relative merits at the time of choosing (the tug-of-war model), applies to our experimental animal, the European Starling, Sturnus vulgaris. We contrast this with the sequential choice model that postulates that decision-makers make no comparison between options at the time of choice. According to the latter, behaviour in simultaneous choices reflects adaptations to contexts with sequential encounters, in which the choice is whether to take an opportunity or let it pass. We postulate that, in sequential encounters, the decision-maker assigns (by learning) a subjective value to each option, reflecting its payoff relative to background opportunities. This value is expressed as latency and/or probability to accept each opportunity as opposed to keep searching. In simultaneous encounters, choice occurs through each option being processed independently, by a race between the mechanisms that generate option-specific latencies.

We investigated how this ability emerges from the behaviors used by ants to recruit nestmates to potential homes. We found that, in a given emigration, only one-third of the colony's workers ever recruit. At first, they summon fellow recruiters via tandem runs, in which a single follower is physically led all the way to the new site. They later switch to recruiting the passive majority of the colony via transports, in which nestmates are simply carried to the site. After this switch, tandem runs continue sporadically but now run in the opposite direction, leading recruiters back to the old nest. Recruitment accelerates with the start of transport, which proceeds at a rate 3 times greater than that of tandem runs. The recruitment switch is triggered by population increase at the new site, such that ants lead tandem runs when the site is relatively empty, but change to transport once a quorum of nestmates is present. A model shows that the quorum requirement can help a colony choose the best available site, even when few ants have the opportunity to compare sites directly, because recruiters to a given site launch the rapid transport of the bulk of the colony only if enough active ants have been ""convinced"" of the worth of the site. This exemplifies how insect societies can achieve adaptive colony-level behaviors from the decentralized interactions of relatively poorly informed insects, each combining her own limited direct information with indirect cues about the experience of her nestmates."

"[""Thomas D. Seeley"", ""Susannah C. Buhrman""]"	"Abstract. This study views a honey bee swarm as a supraorganismal entity which has been shaped by natural selection to be skilled at choosing a future home site. Prior studies of this decision-making process indicate that swarms attempt to use the best-of-N decision rule: sample some number (N) of alternatives and then select the best one. We tested how well swarms implement this decision rule by presenting them with an array of five nest boxes, only one of which was a high-quality (desirable) nest site; the other four were medium-quality (acceptable) sites. We found that swarms are reasonably good at carrying out the best-of-N decision rule: in four out of five trials, swarms selected the best site. In addition, we gained insights into how a swarm implements this decision rule. We found that when a scout bee returns to the swarm cluster and advertises a potential nest site with a waggle dance, she tunes the strength of her dance in relation to the quality of her site: the better the site, the stronger the dance. A dancing bee tunes her dance strength by adjusting the number of waggle-runs/dance, and she adjusts the number of waggle-runs/dance by changing both the duration and the rate of her waggle-run production. Moreover, we found that a dancing bee changes the rate of her waggle-run production by changing the mean duration of the return-phase portion of her dance circuits. Differences in return-phase duration underlie the impression that dances differ in liveliness. Although a honey bee swarm has bounded rationality (e.g., it lacks complete knowledge of the possible nesting sites), through its capacity for parallel processing it can choose a nest site without greatly reducing either the breadth or depth of its consideration of the alternative sites. Such thoroughness of information gathering and processing no doubt helps a swarm implement the best-of-N decision rule."

I repeatedly video-taped individually identifiable jays as they landed on a feeding platform and chose from presentations of peanuts that varied in the number of items or in the distribution of sizes. I examined how differences among these presentations and a bird's social status affected the amount of assessment and the economic consequences of choice. I also examined the specific patterns of handling peanuts, called sampling, to quantify the degree to which sampling sequences were typified by repeated comparisons among sampled peanuts (retrospective sampling), or sequential assessment and rejection of peanuts (prospective sampling). Peanut assessment was more extensive and prospective when there were many options from which to choose than when there were few. Peanut assessment was more extensive and retrospective when options were similar in size than when they varied. Scrub-jays were more likely to make repeated comparisons immediately before selecting a peanut than elsewhere in a sampling sequence. Subordinate scrub-jays, who were at the greatest risk of pre-emption by competitors, assessed peanuts less extensively and were more prospective in their sampling than dominants. Unless peanuts were very similar in size, jays were more accurate at selecting a high-quality peanut and achieved a higher rate of food storage than if they had not assessed. These results show that scrub-jays can adaptively modify how they search to improve their rate of food storage, and also suggest some of the specific search tactics used by jays when assessing peanuts."

CCT26	5225915	A Simple Threshold Rule Is Sufficient to Explain Sophisticated Collective Decision-Making	Elva Robinson	Behavioral mechanisms of collective nest-site choice by the ant Temnothorax curvispinosus	"[""S. C. Pratt""]"	"Abstract.This paper examines the individual behavior underlying collective choice among nest sites by the ant Temnothorax (formerly Leptothorax) curvispinosus. Colonies can actively compare options, rejecting a mediocre site when it is paired with a good one, but accepting the same mediocre design if it is instead paired with a worse site. This ability emerges from the behavior of an active minority of workers who organize emigrations. When one of these finds a promising site, she recruits nest mates to it, but only after a delay that varies inversely with site quality. Ants first recruit fellow active ants via slow tandem runs, but eventually switch to speedier transports of the colony's passive majority. Later transports grow faster still, as ants improve their speed with experience. An ant's choice of recruitment type is governed by a quorum rule, such that her likelihood of starting to transport increases with the population of the new site. The size of the quorum depends on experience, with ants demanding a larger population to launch immediately into transport than they do to switch to transport after first leading a few tandem runs. Perception of quorum attainment requires direct contact between ants. The ants' behavior qualitatively matches that of T. albipennis, where models have shown that decentralized choice of the best site depends on quality-dependent recruitment delays, amplified by a quorum rule for initiating transport. Parameter estimates for an agent-based model show significant quantitative differences between the species, and suggest that T. albipennis may place relatively greater emphasis on emigration speed."

CCT31	5225915	A Simple Threshold Rule Is Sufficient to Explain Sophisticated Collective Decision-Making	Elva Robinson	Collective decision-making in honey bees: how colonies choose among nectar sources	"[""ThomasD. Seeley"", ""Scott Camazine"", ""James Sneyd""]"	"A honey bee colony can skillfully choose among nectar sources. It will selectively exploit the most profitable source in an array and will rapidly shift its foraging efforts following changes in the array. How does this colony-level ability emerge from the behavior of individual bees? The answer lies in understanding how bees modulate their colony's rates of recruitment and abandonment for nectar sources in accordance with the profitability of each source. A forager modulates its behavior in relation to nectar source profitability: as profitability increases, the tempo of foraging increases, the intensity of dancing increases, and the probability of abandoning the source decreases. How does a forager assess the profitability of its nectar source? Bees accomplish this without making comparisons among nectar sources. Neither do the foragers compare different nectar sources to determine the relative profitability of any one source, nor do the food storers compare different nectar loads and indicate the relative profitability of each load to the foragers. Instead, each forager knows only about its particular nectar source and independently calculates the absolute profitability of its source. Even though each of a colony's foragers operates with extremely limited information about the colony's food sources, together they will generate a coherent colonylevel response to different food sources in which better ones are heavily exploited and poorer ones are abandoned. This is shown by a computer simulation of nectar-source selection by a colony in which foragers behave as described above. Nectar-source selection by honey bee colonies is a process of natural selection among alternative nectar sources as foragers from more profitable sources ÒsurviveÓ (continue visiting their source) longer and ÒreproduceÓ (recruit other foragers) better than do foragers from less profitable sources. Hence this colonial decision-making is based on decentralized control. We suggest that honey bee colonies possess decentralized decision-making because it combines effectiveness with simplicity of communication and computation within a colony."

"[""Lars Chittka"", ""Jeremy Niven""]"	"Attempts to relate brain size to behaviour and cognition have rarely integrated information from insects with that from vertebrates. Many insects, however, demonstrate that highly differentiated motor repertoires, extensive social structures and cognition are possible with very small brains, emphasising that we need to understand the neural circuits, not just the size of brain regions, which underlie these feats. Neural network analyses show that cognitive features found in insects, such as numerosity, attention and categorisation-like processes, may require only very limited neuron numbers. Thus, brain size may have less of a relationship with behavioural repertoire and cognitive capacity than generally assumed, prompting the question of what large brains are for. Larger brains are, at least partly, a consequence of larger neurons that are necessary in large animals due to basic biophysical constraints. They also contain greater replication of neuronal circuits, adding precision to sensory processes, detail to perception, more parallel processing and enlarged storage capacity. Yet, these advantages are unlikely to produce the qualitative shifts in behaviour that are often assumed to accompany increased brain size.

A proximate-level hypothesis was tested about decision making in honey bees, Apis mellifera. Fifteen bees were given binary choices between artificial flowers that varied in depth and in volume of sucrose-water delivered. Three bees violated weak stochastic transitivity, under an assumption about the order in which the flowers ranked along a utility scale; they preferred flower A to flower B, B to C, C to D, but D to A. These bees also violated strong stochastic transitivity, which focuses on the strength rather than the direction of preference. An intransitive pattern of choice supports the hypothesis of 'comparative' evaluation of flowers, where options are compared along their different dimensions, each dimension separately. Intransitivities cannot be explained by an 'absolute' model, where each option is evaluated independently and assigned a fixed value (utility). Twelve of the bees made choices that were consistent with both absolute and comparative models of decision making. In light of the above results it is suggested that the assumption that animals employ an absolute method of decision making be reconsidered, and perhaps supplemented with a comparative account. Possible evolutionary advantages of comparative evaluations are discussed."

Edwards"", ""Stephen C. Pratt""]"	"Economic models of animal behaviour assume that decision-makers are rational, meaning that they assess options according to intrinsic fitness value and not by comparison with available alternatives. This expectation is frequently violated, but the significance of irrational behaviour remains controversial. One possibility is that irrationality arises from cognitive constraints that necessitate short cuts like comparative evaluation. If so, the study of whether and when irrationality occurs can illuminate cognitive mechanisms. We applied this logic in a novel setting: the collective decisions of insect societies. We tested for irrationality in colonies of Temnothorax ants choosing between two nest sites that varied in multiple attributes, such that neither site was clearly superior. In similar situations, individual animals show irrational changes in preference when a third relatively unattractive option is introduced. In contrast, we found no such effect in colonies. We suggest that immunity to irrationality in this case may result from the ants' decentralized decision mechanism. A colony's choice does not depend on site comparison by individuals, but instead self-organizes from the interactions of multiple ants, most of which are aware of only a single site. This strategy may filter out comparative effects, preventing systematic errors that would otherwise arise from the cognitive limitations of individuals."	"For example, emigrating T. albipennis colonies follow rational transitivity patterns in decision making [16] and in the related species T. curvispinosus and T. rugatulus, colonies seem to be immune to irrational distractor effects from irrelevant alternatives [25,#AUTHOR_TAG]."

Electroantennogram assays indicated that peripheral perception was not affected; the effects apparently occurred in the central nervous system.

Coupled with other studies (Breed 1983; Robinson 1985), they also suggest that: 1) aggression in the honey bee is hormonally mediated and 2) a single hormone is involved in both the production and perception of an olfactory communication signal, the first report of this phenomenon in an invertebrate."

Studies of division of labor are concerned with the integration of individual worker behavior into colony level task organization and with the question of how regulation of division of labor may contribute to colony efficiency. Here we describe and critique the current models concerned with the proximate causes of division of labor in social insects. The models have identified various proximate mechanisms to explain division of labor, based on both internal and external factors. On the basis of these factors, we suggest a classification of the models. We first describe the different types of models and then review the empirical evidence supporting them. The models to date may be considered preliminary and exploratory; they have advanced our understanding by suggesting possible mechanisms for division of labor and by revealing how individual and colony-level behavior may be related. They suggest specific hypotheses that can be tested by experiment and so may lead to the development of more powerful and integrative explanatory models."

CCT40	5225915	A Simple Threshold Rule Is Sufficient to Explain Sophisticated Collective Decision-Making	Elva Robinson	The effect of prior experience on nest site evaluation by the ant Temnothorax curvispinosus	"[""Christiane I.M. Healey"", ""Stephen C. Pratt""]"	"Animals are expected to follow decision-making strategies that balance the benefits of choosing the best option with the costs of finding and assessing candidates. Because costs and benefits will vary across time and space, an animal may profit by adjusting its tactics according to recent experience. In particular, animals should be less selective when experience indicates that the average quality of options is low. We tested this prediction in the context of nest site selection by the ant Temnothorax curvispinosus. Colonies received prolonged exposure either to a good or to a poor nest and then were tested for their readiness to accept a mediocre nest. Previous studies have shown that colonies move more rapidly into nests that they rate more highly, as a result of faster recruitment initiation by individual ants. Hence, if exposure to a low-quality nest makes colonies more willing to accept a mediocre one, we predicted speedier moves into the mediocre nest after the poor treatment than after the good treatment. Our results showed a clear effect of treatment, but contrary to our prediction, ants moved more rapidly after living in a good nest than after living in a poor nest. We discuss three effects that may explain these results: (1) quality-dependent changes in colony condition, (2) quality-dependent changes in colony size and (3) differences in the urgency of emigration perceived by ants in the two nest types. Our finding illustrates that animal collectives, like individuals, use recent experience to tune their decision strategies."

Morphological, genotypic, and age variations among workers, as well as their social interactions, all shape division of labor [1-12]. In addition, individual experience has been suggested to influence workers in their decision to execute a task [13-18], but its potential impact on the organization of insect societies has yet to be demonstrated [19, 20]. Here we show that, all else being equal, ant workers engaged in distinct functions in accordance with their previous experience. When individuals were experimentally led to discover prey at each of their foraging attempts, they showed a high propensity for food exploration. Conversely, foraging activity progressively decreased for individuals who always failed in the same situation. One month later, workers that previously found prey kept on exploring for food, whereas those who always failed specialized in brood care. It thus appears that individual experience can strongly channel the behavioral ontogeny of ants to generate a lasting division of labor. This self-organized task-attribution system, based on an individual learning process, is particularly robust and might play an important role in colony efficiency."

Imbibing time and imbibed volume of individuals were the same at feeders containing 20% or 40% w/w (weight in weight) sugar solution. However, sugar intake rate and sugar per crop load were significantly higher for the 40% solution, which was therefore more profitable. Collective foraging of two colonies was observed without interference with the recruitment process. One bee was trained to a 20% food source and another at the same time to a 40% source. Recruitment to both food sources started simultaneously. In all trials the majority of recruits landed at the 40% food source. This cannot be the result of bees comparing the two sugar concentrations because less than 1% of the recruits landed at both feeders. When we offered the 20% food source 90 min before the 40% source, the newcomers at the 40% food source never outnumbered the newcomers at the 20% source. Significantly more recruits landed at the less profitable food source. This is likely to be caused by a positive feedback resulting from the large number of bees that had already exploited the poor source and reinforced the scent trail. New recruits presumably selected the more intensively marked trail, neglecting the new and weakly marked one that would lead them to the richer food."

Kirk Visscher""]"	"The choice of a new nest site is ecologically critical for an insect colony. In swarm-founding social insects, or those that move as colonies from one site to another, this choice is one of the best-available examples of a distributed, nonhierarchical decision-making process in animals. In the few species of ants and bees that have been studied in detail, the main features of this collective decision making are strikingly similar, although some differences occur. Individual scouts discover potential nest sites and integrate multiple properties of these sites into assessments of their quality. The discovered sites then compete for a limited pool of nest-site scouts, and attrition of less-favored sites occurs by several mechanisms. Finally, the mass movement of the colony to the new site is triggered by a quorum-sensing mechanism when sufficient scouts are present at one of the alternatives. Movement itself is coordinated by different mechanisms in different insects."	"Searching for alternatives has a more prominent role in later versions of the recruitment latency model [24] making it more similar to our threshold model, however, the idea of simple quality-dependent recruitment latencies functioning as a choice mechanism still appears often in discussions of collective decisionmaking [11,#AUTHOR_TAG,39]."

CCT44	5225915	A Simple Threshold Rule Is Sufficient to Explain Sophisticated Collective Decision-Making	Elva Robinson	A Negative Feedback Signal That Is Triggered by Peril Curbs Honey Bee Recruitment	"[""James C. Nieh""]"	"Decision making in superorganisms such as honey bee colonies often uses self-organizing behaviors, feedback loops that allow the colony to gather information from multiple individuals and achieve reliable and agile solutions. Honey bees use positive feedback from the waggle dance to allocate colony foraging effort. However, the use of negative feedback signals by superorganisms is poorly understood. I show that conspecific attacks at a food source lead to the production of stop signals, communication that was known to reduce waggle dancing and recruitment but lacked a clear natural trigger. Signalers preferentially targeted nestmates visiting the same food source, on the basis of its odor. During aggressive food competition, attack victims increased signal production by 43 fold. Foragers that attacked competitors or experienced no aggression did not alter signal production. Biting ambush predators also attack foragers at flowers. Simulated biting of foragers or exposure to bee alarm pheromone also elicited signaling (88-fold and 14-fold increases, respectively). This provides the first clear evidence of a negative feedback signal elicited by foraging peril to counteract the positive feedback of the waggle dance. As in intra- and intercellular communication, negative feedback may play an important, though currently underappreciated, role in self-organizing behaviors within superorganisms.Copyright  2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Seeley"", ""Alexander S. Mikheyev"", ""Gary J. Pagano""]"	"For more than 50 years, investigators of the honey bee's waggle dance have reported that richer food sources seem to elicit longer-lasting and livelier dances than do poorer sources. However, no one had measured both dance duration and liveliness as a function of food-source profitability. Using video analysis, we found that nectar foragers adjust both the duration (D) and the rate (R) of waggle-run production, thereby tuning the number of waggle runs produced per foraging trip (W, where W= DR) as a function of food-source profitability. Both duration and rate of waggle-run production increase with rising food-source profitability. Moreover, we found that a dancing bee adjusts the rate of waggle-run production (R) in relation to food-source profitability by adjusting the mean duration of the return-phase portion of her dance circuits. This finding raises the possibility that bees can use return-phase duration as an index of food-source profitability. Finally, dances having different levels of liveliness have different mean durations of the return phase, indicating that dance liveliness can be quantified in terms of the time interval between consecutive waggle runs."

Briscoe"", ""Lars Chittka""]"	"We review the physiological, molecular, and neural mechanisms of insect color vision. Phylogenetic and molecular analyses reveal that the basic bauplan, UV-blue-green-trichromacy, appears to date back to the Devonian ancestor of all pterygote insects. There are variations on this theme, however. These concern the number of color receptor types, their differential expression across the retina, and their fine tuning along the wavelength scale. In a few cases (but not in many others), these differences can be linked to visual ecology. Other insects have virtually identical sets of color receptors despite strong differences in lifestyle. Instead of the adaptionism that has dominated visual ecology in the past, we propose that chance evolutionary processes, history, and constraints should be considered. In addition to phylogenetic analyses designed to explore these factors, we suggest quantifying variance between individuals and populations and using fitness measurements to test the adaptive value of traits identified in insect color vision systems."

CCT47	5225915	A Simple Threshold Rule Is Sufficient to Explain Sophisticated Collective Decision-Making	Elva Robinson	A Comparative Bayes tactic for mate assessment and choice	"[""Barney Luttbeg""]"	"Models of mate choice tactics have assumed that females randomly encounter males when collecting information and the information is perfect. Empirical observations of four bird species show that females selectively visit males and repeat visits to males before mating. This suggests that the assumptions of previous models have been too restrictive. An alternative model of information gathering and mate choice, which relaxes the assumptions of random encounters and perfect information, is presented. In this Comparative Bayes model, the decision of when and from whom to collect information is made using Bayesian estimates of each male's quality. Predictions from the model are that: (1) the occurrence of mate assessment will increase as initial uncertainty about the quality of males increases, as the cost of gathering information decreases, and as the signal perceived by the female becomes a better representation of males' actual qualities; (2) the occurrence of repeat visits to males will be highest when signals from males are of medium reliability; and (3) the decision of which male to assess will depend on the estimated qualities of males, prior certainty about each male's quality, the reliability of each male's signal, and the costs of assessment. Simulations compare the fitness outcomes of the Comparative Bayes tactic to other mate choice tactics. The fitness from the Comparative Bayes tactic is significantly higher than from the fixed threshold tactic and than from the best-of-n tactic when the cost of assessment is low."

Passino"", ""Thomas D.

We develop a model of this process and validate that the model possesses the key features of the bees' decision-making process, as revealed by prior empirical studies. Next, we use the model to study the ""design"" of the nest-site selection process, with a focus on how certain behavioral parameters have been tuned by natural selection to achieve a balance between speed and accuracy. First, we study the effects of the quorum threshold and the dance decay rate. We show that evolution seems to have settled on values for these two parameters that seek a balance between speed and accuracy of decision making by minimizing the time needed to achieve a consensus and maximizing the probability that the best site is chosen. Second, we study the adaptive tuning of the tendency of bees to explore for vs be recruited to a site. We show that this tendency appears to be tuned to regulate the positive feedback process of recruitment to ensure both a reasonably rapid choice and a low probability of a poor choice. Finally we show that the probability of choosing the best site is proportional to its quality, but that this proportionality depends on its quality relative to other discovered sites."

Kirk Visscher""]"	"This study investigates the first stage of the decision-making process of a honeybee swarm as it chooses a nest site: how a scout bee codes the value of a potential nest site in the waggle dances she produces to represent this site. We presented honeybee swarms with a two-alternative choice between a high-value site and a medium-value site and recorded the behavior of individually identifiable scout bees as they reported on these two alternatives. We found that bees performed equally lengthy inspections at the two sites, but that, on the swarm cluster, they performed more dance circuits per bee for the high-value site. We also found that there was much individual-level noise in the coding of site value, but that there were clear population-level differences in total dance circuits produced for the two sites. The first bee to find a site had a high probability of reporting the site with a waggle dance, regardless of its value. This discoverer-should-dance phenomenon may help ensure that a swarm gives attention to all discovered sites. There was rapid decay in the dance response; the number of dance circuits produced by a bee after visiting a site decreased linearly over sequential visits, and eventually each bee ceased visiting her site. This decay, or ;leakage', in the accumulation of bees at a site improves a swarm's decision-making ability by helping a swarm avoid making fast-decision errors."

comparisons or use the information to decide when and where to start recruiting.', 'These results also clearly demonstrate that a phenomenon observed when only one option is available, cannot be assumed to function in the same way when choosing between multiple options (see also [7]).', 'Another well-studied example of collective decision-making is nest-site choice by swarming honeybees (Apis mellifera).', 'Like ant colonies, bee swarms are able to choose between different nest sites, and individual bees do not need to have visited multiple sites for the swarm to be able to choose between them [40].', 'However, the way the scouts act on this information differs between the two groups.', 'The ants seem to use a binary decision process to either accept that nest or continue searching.', 'Ants accepting a nest recruit others, causing a positive feedback process, but ant scouts do not modulate their recruitment according to nest quality, e.g. by recruiting at a faster rate or for longer to a higher quality nest [20,26].', 'In contrast, bees use a graded process, whereby scouts initially discovering a new nest-site almost always recruit #AUTHOR_TAG, but the duration and rate of the recruiting waggle-dances are dependent on nest quality [42].', 'This means that more recruits are brought to better nest-sites, leading to a positive feedback process usually resulting in a unanimous choice of the better site [42].', 'One possible reason for this difference in strategy could be differences in nest availability: if suitable honeybee nest sites are relatively rare, then it might be better for scouts to avoid ever rejecting a potential nest outright.']"	1
CCT52	5225915	A Simple Threshold Rule Is Sufficient to Explain Sophisticated Collective Decision-Making	Elva Robinson	Tactics of dance choice in honey bees: do foragers compare dances?	"[""ThomasD. Seeley"", ""WilliamF. Towne""]"	"Summary(1) When a honey bee follows recruitment dances to locate a new food source, does she sample multiple dances representing different food sources and selectively respond to the strongest dance? (2) Several initial findings suggested that foragers might indeed compare dances. First, dance information is arrayed in the hive in a way that facilitates comparison-making: dances for different flower patches are performed close together in time and space. Second, food-source quality is coded in the dances, in terms of dance length (number of circuits per dance). Third, dances to natural food sources vary in length by more than 2 orders of magnitude, indicating that the quality of natural food sources varies greatly. Fourth, foragers seeking a new food source follow several dances before exiting the hive (though only one dance is followed closely). (3) Nevertheless, a critical test for comparison-making revealed that foragers evidently do not compare dances. A colony was given two feeders that were equidistant from the hive but different in profitability. If foragers do not compare dances, then the proportion of recruits arriving at the richer feeder should match the proportion of dance circuits for the richer feeder. This is the pattern that we found in all 11 trials of the experiment. (4) We suggest that the reason foragers do not compare dances is that a colony's foraging success is greater if its foragers distribute themselves among the various food sources being advertised in the hive than if they crowd themselves on the one, best source. (5) Food-source selection by honey bee colonies is a democratic decision-making process. This study reveals that this selection process is organized to function effectively even though each member of the democracy possesses incomplete information about the available choices."	"Foraging honeybees do not compare food sources [43], nor do they compare the waggle-dances of recruiters at the hive #AUTHOR_TAG."

The sample was predominantly male (62%) and white (92%), and 34% were current smokers.Practices were randomised to three interventions, each of which built on the previous one: a patient information leaflet control group, five minutes of structured brief advice, and 20 minutes of brief lifestyle counselling. Delivery of the patient leaflet and brief advice occurred directly after screening and brief lifestyle counselling in a subsequent consultation.The primary outcome was patients' self reported hazardous or harmful drinking status as measured by the alcohol use disorders identification test (AUDIT) at six months. A negative AUDIT result (score <8) indicated non-hazardous or non-harmful drinking. Secondary outcomes were a negative AUDIT result at 12 months, experience of alcohol related problems (alcohol problems questionnaire), health utility (EQ-5D), service utilisation, and patients' motivation to change drinking behaviour (readiness to change) as measured by a modified readiness ruler.Patient follow-up rates were 83% at six months (n=644) and 79% at 12 months (n=617).

Wilson"", ""Catherine A. Lock"", ""Nick Heather"", ""Paul Cassidy"", ""Marilyn M. Christie"", ""Eileen F.S. Kaner""]"	"Reactivity to assessment has attracted recent attention in the brief alcohol intervention literature. This systematic review sought to examine the nature of change in alcohol consumption over time in control groups in brief intervention studies. Primary studies were identified from existing reviews published in English language, peer-reviewed journals between 1995 and 2005. Change in alcohol consumption and selected study-level characteristics for each primary study were extracted. Consumption change data were pooled in random effects models and meta-regression was used to explore predictors of change. Eleven review papers reported the results of 44 individual studies. Twenty-six of these studies provided data suitable for quantitative study. Extreme heterogeneity was identified and the extent of observed reduction in consumption over time was greater in studies undertaken in Anglophone countries, with single gender study participants, and without special targeting by age. Heterogeneity was reduced but was still substantial in a sub-set of 15 general population studies undertaken in English language countries. The actual content of the control group procedure itself was not predictive of reduction in drinking, nor were a range of other candidate variables including setting, the exclusion of dependent drinkers, the collection of a biological sample at follow-up, and duration of study. Further investigations may yield novel insights into the nature of behaviour change with potential to inform brief interventions design."

We systematically reviewed the literature on implementation studies of alcohol SBI using a broad conceptual model of implementation, the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), to identify domains addressed by programs that achieved high rates of screening and/or brief intervention (BI). Seventeen articles from 8 implementation programs were included; studies were conducted in 9 countries and represented 533,903 patients (127,304 patients screened), 2,001 providers, and 1,805 clinics. Rates of SBI varied across articles (2-93% for screening and 0.9-73.1% for BI). Implementation programs described use of 7-25 of the 39 CFIR elements. Most programs used strategies that spanned all 5 domains of the CFIR with varying emphases on particular domains and sub-domains. Comparison of SBI rates was limited by most studies' being conducted by 2 implementation programs and by different outcome measures, scopes, and durations. However, one implementation program reported a high rate of screening relative to other programs (93%) and could be distinguished by its use of strategies that related to the Inner Setting, Outer Setting, and Process of Implementation domains of the CFIR. Future studies could assess whether focusing on Inner Setting, Outer Setting, and Process of Implementation elements of the CFIR during implementation is associated with successful implementation of alcohol screening, as well as which elements may be associated with successful, sustained implementation of BI.(PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2011 APA, all rights reserved)."

Articles of this sort have appeared from time to time since the mid-1950s, but the present situation appears to be different in two important respects. For the first time, the American Psychological Association (APA) Board of Scientific Affairs is looking into the possibility of taking the lead in the effort to reform data analysis procedures.

To know whether a non-significant result counts against a theory, or if it just indicates data insensitivity, researchers must use one of: power, intervals (such as confidence or credibility intervals), or else an indicator of the relative evidence for one theory over another, such as a Bayes factor. I argue Bayes factors allow theory to be linked to data in a way that overcomes the weaknesses of the other approaches. Specifically, Bayes factors use the data themselves to determine their sensitivity in distinguishing theories (unlike power), and they make use of those aspects of a theory's predictions that are often easiest to specify (unlike power and intervals, which require specifying the minimal interesting value in order to address theory). Bayes factors provide a coherent approach to determining whether non-significant results support a null hypothesis over a theory, or whether the data are just insensitive.

CCT67	82875399	Interpreting Null Findings from Trials of Alcohol Brief Interventions	Nick Heather	Regression to the mean and alcohol consumption: A cohort study exploring implications for the interpretation of change in control groups in brief intervention trials	"[""V. Morton""]"	"BACKGROUND: Reductions in drinking among individuals randomised to control groups in brief alcohol intervention trials are common and suggest that asking study participants about their drinking may itself cause them to reduce their consumption. We sought to test the hypothesis that the statistical artefact regression to the mean (RTM) explains part of the reduction in such studies. METHODS: 967 participants in a cohort study of alcohol consumption in New Zealand provided data at baseline and again six months later. We use graphical methods and apply thresholds of 8, 12, 16 and 20 in AUDIT scores to explore RTM. RESULTS: There was a negative association between baseline AUDIT scores and change in AUDIT scores from baseline to six months, which in the absence of bias and confounding, is RTM. Students with lower baseline scores tended to have higher follow-up scores and conversely, those with higher baseline scores tended to have lower follow-up scores. When a threshold score of 8 was used to select a subgroup, the observed mean change was approximately half of that observed without a threshold. The application of higher thresholds produced greater apparent reductions in alcohol consumption. CONCLUSIONS: Part of the reduction seen in the control groups of brief alcohol intervention trials is likely to be due to RTM and the amount of change is likely to be greater as the threshold for entry to the trial increases. Quantification of RTM warrants further study and should assist understanding assessment and other research participation effects"	The possible effects of regression to the mean on control group participants in brief intervention trials were studied empirically by McCambridge and colleagues #AUTHOR_TAG.

OBJECTIVE To appraise evidence on the association of CYP2C19 genotype and clopidogrel response through systematic review and meta-analysis.   DATA SOURCES PubMed and EMBASE from their inception to October 2011.   STUDY SELECTION Studies that reported clopidogrel metabolism, platelet reactivity or clinically relevant outcomes (cardiovascular disease [CVD] events and bleeding), and information on CYP2C19 genotype were included.   DATA EXTRACTION We extracted information on study design, genotyping, and disease outcomes and investigated sources of bias.   RESULTS We retrieved 32 studies of 42,016 patients reporting 3545 CVD events, 579 stent thromboses, and 1413 bleeding events. Six studies were randomized trials (""effect-modification"" design) and the remaining 26 reported individuals exposed to clopidogrel (""treatment-only"" design). In treatment-only analysis, individuals with 1 or more CYP2C19 alleles associated with lower enzyme activity had lower levels of active clopidogrel metabolites, less platelet inhibition, lower risk of bleeding (relative risk [RR], 0.84; 95% CI, 0.75-0.94; absolute risk reduction of 5-8 events per 1000 individuals), and higher risk of CVD events (RR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.09-1.28; absolute risk increase of 8-12 events per 1000 individuals). However, there was evidence of small-study bias (Harbord test P = .001). When analyses were restricted to studies with 200 or more events, the point estimate was attenuated (RR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.86-1.09). In effect-modification studies, CYP2C19 genotype was not associated with modification of the effect of clopidogrel on CVD end points or bleeding (P > .05 for interaction for both). Other limitations included selective outcome reporting and potential for genotype misclassification due to problems with the * allele nomenclature for cytochrome enzymes.   CONCLUSION Although there was an association between the CYP2C19 genotype and clopidogrel responsiveness, overall there was no significant association of genotype with cardiovascular events."

Andersson"", ""Marie Ahlstr\u00f6m"", ""Lars Weidolf""]"	"The human clearance of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) of the substituted benzimidazole class is conducted primarily by the hepatic cytochrome P450 (P450) system. To compare the potency and specificity of the currently used PPIs (i.e., omeprazole, esomeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole, and rabeprazole) as inhibitors of four cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4), we performed in vitro studies using human liver microsomal preparations and recombinant CYP2C19. Sample analysis was done using selected reaction monitoring liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectometry. With several systems for CYP2C19 activity (two marker reactions, S-mephenytoin 4'-hydroxylation and R-omeprazole 5-hydroxylation, tested in either human liver microsomes or recombinant CYP2C19), the five PPIs showed competitive inhibition of CYP2C19 activity with K(i) of 0.4 to 1.5 microM for lansoprazole, 2 to 6 microM for omeprazole, approximately 8 microM for esomeprazole, 14 to 69 microM for pantoprazole, and 17 to 21 microM for rabeprazole. Pantoprazole was a competitive inhibitor of both CYP2C9-catalyzed diclofenac 4'-hydroxylation and CYP3A4-catalyzed midazolam 1'-hydroxylation (K(i) of 6 and 22 microM, respectively), which were at least 2 times more potent than the other PPIs. All PPIs were poor inhibitors of CYP2D6-mediated bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation with IC(50) > 200 microM. The inhibitory potency of a nonenzymatically formed product of rabeprazole, rabeprazole thioether, was also investigated and showed potent, competitive inhibition with K(i) values of 6 microM for CYP2C9, 2 to 8 microM for CYP2C19, 12 microM for CYP2D6, and 15 microM for CYP3A4. The inhibitory potency of R-omeprazole on the four studied P450 enzymes was also studied and showed higher inhibitory potency than its S-isomer on CYP2C9 and 2C19 activities. Our data suggest that, although the inhibitory profiles of the five studied PPIs were similar, lansoprazole and pantoprazole are the most potent in vitro inhibitors of CYP2C19 and CYP2C9, respectively. Esomeprazole showed less inhibitory potency compared with omeprazole and its R-enantiomer. The inhibitory potency of rabeprazole was relatively lower than the other PPIs, but its thioether analog showed potent inhibition on the P450 enzymes investigated, which may be clinically significant."

Farid"", ""Osamu Okazaki"", ""Toshihiko Ikeda"", ""Atsushi Kurihara""]"	"The aim of the current study is to identify the human cytochrome P450 (P450) isoforms involved in the two oxidative steps in the bioactivation of clopidogrel to its pharmacologically active metabolite. In the in vitro experiments using cDNA-expressed human P450 isoforms, clopidogrel was metabolized to 2-oxo-clopidogrel, the immediate precursor of its pharmacologically active metabolite. CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP2C19 catalyzed this reaction. In the same system using 2-oxo-clopidogrel as the substrate, detection of the active metabolite of clopidogrel required the addition of glutathione to the system. CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 contributed to the production of the active metabolite. Secondly, the contribution of each P450 involved in both oxidative steps was estimated by using enzyme kinetic parameters. The contribution of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP2C19 to the formation of 2-oxo-clopidogrel was 35.8, 19.4, and 44.9%, respectively. The contribution of CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 to the formation of the active metabolite was 32.9, 6.76, 20.6, and 39.8%, respectively. In the inhibition studies with antibodies and selective chemical inhibitors to P450s, the outcomes obtained by inhibition studies were consistent with the results of P450 contributions in each oxidative step. These studies showed that CYP2C19 contributed substantially to both oxidative steps required in the formation of clopidogrel active metabolite and that CYP3A4 contributed substantially to the second oxidative step. These results help explain the role of genetic polymorphism of CYP2C19 and also the effect of potent CYP3A inhibitors on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of clopidogrel in humans and on clinical outcomes."

Platelet function measurements during clopidogrel treatment demonstrated a variable and overall modest level of P2Y(12) inhibition. High on-treatment platelet reactivity to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) was observed in selected patients. Multiple studies have now demonstrated a clear association between high on-treatment platelet reactivity to ADP measured by multiple methods and adverse clinical event occurrence. However, the routine measurement of platelet reactivity has not been widely implemented and recommended in the guidelines. Reasons for the latter include: 1) a lack of consensus on the optimal method to quantify high on-treatment platelet reactivity and the cutoff value associated with clinical risk; and 2) limited data to support that alteration of therapy based on platelet function measurements actually improves outcomes.

We observed that pharmacodynamic response to clopidogrel was significantly associated with the CYP2C19 genotype. Twenty of the subjects were wild-type CYP2C19 (*1/*1) homozygotes, while the other 8 subjects were heterozygous for the loss-of-function polymorphism CYP2C19*2 (*1/*2). Baseline platelet activity was not influenced by the CYP2C19 genotype.

Bates"", ""Wei C. Lau"", ""Dominick J. Angiolillo""]"	"Multidrug therapy increases the risk for drug-drug interactions. Clopidogrel, a prodrug, requires hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) metabolic activation to produce the active metabolite that inhibits the platelet P2Y12 adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor, decreasing platelet activation and aggregation processes. Atorvastatin, omeprazole, and several other drugs have been shown in pharmacodynamic studies to competitively inhibit CYP activation of clopidogrel, reducing clopidogrel responsiveness. Conversely, other agents increase clopidogrel responsiveness by inducing CYP activity. The clinical implications of these pharmacodynamic interactions have raised concern because many of these drugs are coadministered to patients with coronary artery disease. There are multiple challenges in proving that a pharmacodynamic drug-drug interaction is clinically significant. To date, there is no consistent evidence that clopidogrel-drug interactions impact adverse cardiovascular events. Statins and proton pump inhibitors have been shown to decrease adverse clinical event rates and should not be withheld from patients with appropriate indications for therapy because of concern about potential clopidogrel-drug interactions.

In a previous observational study, we found clopidogrel activity on platelets, tested by vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) phosphorylation, to be diminished in patients receiving proton pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment.In this double-blind placebo-controlled trial, all consecutive patients undergoing coronary artery stent implantation received aspirin (75 mg/day) and clopidogrel (loading dose, followed by 75 mg/day) and were randomized to receive either associated omeprazole (20 mg/day) or placebo for 7 days. Clopidogrel effect was tested on days 1 and 7 in both groups by measuring platelet phosphorylated-VASP expressed as a platelet reactivity index (PRI). Our main end point compared PRI value at the 7-day treatment period in the 2 groups.Data for 124 patients were analyzed.

"[""Y.-H. JEONG"", ""K. P. BLIDEN"", ""U. S. TANTRY"", ""P. A. GURBEL""]"	"Recent consensus of the Working Group has suggested that high on-treatment platelet reactivity (HPR) to ADP is a major cardiovascular risk factor [1]. This document also has provided the potential cut-offs of HPR to ADP for the most commonly used platelet function tests (PFTs), including light transmittance aggregometry (LTA), the VerifyNow P2Y12 assay (VerifyNow), Multiplate and the vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein-phosphorylation (VASP-P) assay. Although the concept of HPR is a major step forward for a personalized antiplatelet therapy strategy in high-risk patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), several issues have been raised and delayed the clinical adoption of PFT [2,3]. The different correlations and degree of agreement between HPR determined by various PFTs are important concerns. Although the various PFTs identify different aspects of platelet biology, several studies have suggested matched cut-offs of HPR measured by LTA, VerifyNow and Multiplate [4,5], strengthening the reliability of the hypothesis of HPR being an important indicator of risk. The higher prevalence of HPR determined by the VASP-P assay in clopidogrelor prasugrel-treated patients (> 50% and 25%, respectively) compared with other assays during clopidogrel therapy (20 40%) [6-10], questions that the consensus-defined cut-off value of > 50% platelet reactivity index (PRI) may be so low that the true proportion of high-risk patients for ischemic events is overestimated [2,3]. If we keep in mind the relatively low rate of post-PCI ischemic events, an estimation of HPR exceeding 50% during clopidogrel therapy may cause unnecessary application of potent P2Y12 receptor inhibitors with an attendant increased risk of bleeding. We therefore performed the current pharmacodynamic analysis to determine the agreement for the definition and the prevalence of HPR among various PFTs in patients with stable coronary artery disease treated with dual antiplatelet therapy [6]. Platelet function measurements from two prospective randomized studies [6] were used in this analysis; 37 and 39 patients were enrolled from our institution and treated with ticagrelor (180-mg loading-dose [LD] and 90-mg twice a day maintenance-dose [MD]) and clopidogrel (600-mg LD and 75mg d MD), respectively. Serial LTA, VerifyNow and VASPP assays were performed, and a total of 1002 matched pairs (ticagrelor = 498 pairs; clopidogrel = 504 pairs) were available for this analysis. The overall inter-assay correlation and receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis determined by the level of platelet inhibition were consistent irrespective of clopidogrel or ticagrelor administration. The LTA values correlated most with VerifyNow (Fig. 1A, r = 0.821) and less well with the VASP-P assay (Fig. 1B, r = 0.688). PRI values in low/ medium responsive patients were more scattered compared with LTAmeasurements, a finding that is in line with previous observations [11,12]. The frequency ofHPR (based on consensus-defined cut-offs) was the greatest by VASP-P PRI (47.5%) compared with 5 lM ADP-induced aggregation > 46% (37.3%) and P2Y12 reaction units (PRU) > 235 (40.0%). A PRU cut-off > 235 showed substantial agreement with > 46% LTA cut-off (j = 0.737; concordance, 87.5%; balanced distribution of discordance) (Fig. 1A). The VASP-P PRI cut-off showed moderate agreement with the LTA cut-off (j = 0.585; concordance, 79.6%; relatively unbalanced distribution of discordance) (Fig. 1B). ROC curve analysis was used to assess the corresponding points to 5 lM ADP-induced aggregation > 46%, PRU > 234 and VASP-P PRI > 60% (Fig. 1C, D). When the new HPR criteria of a VASP PRI > 60% were applied, the agreement with the LTA cut-off improved (j = 0.634; concordance, 82.6%; narrowed discordance) (Fig. 1B: green arrow and numbers). We also performed ROC curve analysis to assess the corresponding cut-offs to VASP-P PRI > 50%. The matched point with 5 lM ADPinduced aggregation was > 37% (AUC [area under curve], 0.887; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.843-0.890; P  167 was identified as the matched point to > 50% VASP-P PRI (AUC, 0.897; 95% CI, 0.875-0.918; P < 0.001; sensitivity, 87.1%; and specificity, 80.3%).

The antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel is commonly assessed by measuring the aggregatory response to 5 mM ADP by light transmission aggregation (LTA) or multiple electrode aggregometry (MEA) or by the vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein platelet reactivity index (VASP-PRI). To determine which of these three tests of platelet ADP receptor pathway inhibition most closely correlates with clopidogrel AM levels. We analyzed blood samples from 82 patients with coronary artery disease who were randomized to receive double-dose or standard dose clopidogrel for 2 weeks. We measured peak clopidogrel AM levels, platelet aggregation in response to ADP and VASP-PRI on days 1, and repeated all the measures on days 7 and 14. Linear regression analysis was used to examine the correlation between clopidogrel AM and LTA, MEA and VASP-PRI. Bland-Altman plots were used to explore the agreement between tests of the antiplatelet effects of clopidogrel. Clopidogrel AM on day 1 correlated most closely with VASP-PRI (r = -0.5767) and demonstrated weaker correlations with LTA (r = -0.4656) and MEA (r = -0.3384) (all p < 0.01). Intra-class correlation (ICC) between VASP-PRI and LTA was 0.6446; VASP-PRI and MEA was 0.4720; and LTA and MEA was 0.4693. Similar results were obtained on days 7 and 14.

Methods: Twenty-four subjects were given oral doses of 100 mg caffeine, 25 mg losartan, 20 mg omeprazole, 10 mg debrisoquin, and 250 mg quinine on separate days. After a washout period of at least 4 days, all drugs were given simultaneously except for quinine, which was given 8 hours after the other drugs. Blood and urine samples were collected to determine parent drug and metabolite concentrations for assessment of phenotyping indices. Any difference between both single and cocktail doses was tested on a log-normal distribution. Results: The phenotypic indices of CYP1A2 (paraxanthine/caffeine in 4-hour plasma), CYP2C9 (losartan/E-3174 [metabolite of losartan] in 0- to 8-hour urine), CYP2C19 (omeprazole/5-hydroxyomeprazole in 3-hour plasma), and CYP3A4 (quinine/3-hydroxyquinine in 16-hour plasma) were not significantly changed when probe drugs were administered alone compared with together, although a tendency toward higher concentrations of losartan was seen during simultaneous administration (95% confidence interval, 0.51-1.002; P =.051). The CYP2D6 phenotypic index (debrisoquin/4-hydroxydebrisoquin in 0- to 8-hour urine) was significantly changed when drugs were given together (95% confidence interval, 0.45-0.87; P =.007), indicating an inhibition of the debrisoquin metabolism. The within-subject coefficients of variation (8%-25%) were much lower than the between-subject coefficients of variation (34%-79%). Conclusions: The administration of drugs together suggests an inhibition of debrisoquin metabolism caused by the concurrent drugs given. By separating debrisoquin from the other cocktail drugs, this method is likely to be used as a tool to phenotype the enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 with only 2 urinary collections and 2 blood-sampling occasions."

The ratio between the plasma concentrations of omeprazole and hydroxyomeprazole (metabolic ratio; MR) was determined by HPLC in a blood sample drawn 3 h after drug intake.

EMs heterozygous for the CYP2C19m1 gene had MRs of omeprazole and S/R ratios of mephenytoin that were higher than those of subjects who were homozygous for the wild-type allele (p = 0.0001). Nineteen of the 22 PMs were homozygous for the CYP2C19m1 gene. Three were heterozygous for this allele. Thus, 41 of the 44 alleles (93%) of PMs were defective CYP2C19m1. One of the remaining three PM alleles was subsequently found to contain the CYP2C19m2 mutation, which has earlier been shown to be associated with the PM phenotype in Oriental populations.

In reviewing this evidence and its clinical impact, the writing group believed it would be more appropriate to expand the title of this guideline to ""Secondary Prevention and Risk Reduction Therapy for Patients With Coronary and Other Atherosclerotic Vascular Disease."" Indeed, the growing body of evidence confirms that in patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease, comprehensive risk factor management reduces risk as assessed by a variety of outcomes, including improved survival, reduced recurrent events, the need for revascularization procedures, and improved quality of life. It is important not only that the healthcare provider implement these recommendations in appropriate patients but also that healthcare systems support this implementation to maximize the benefit to the patient. Compelling evidence-based results from recent clinical trials and revised practice guidelines provide the impetus for this update of the 2006 recommendations with evidence-based results (2-165) (Table 1). Classification of recommendations and level of evidence are expressed in ACCF/AHA format, as detailed in Table 2. Recommendations made herein are largely based on major practice guidelines from the National Institutes of Health and updated ACCF/AHA practice guidelines, as well as on results from recent clinical trials. Thus, the development of the present guideline involved a process of partial adaptation of other guideline statements and reports and supplemental literature searches.

Additional searches cross-referenced these topics with the subtopics of clinical trials, secondary prevention, atherosclerosis, and coronary/cerebral/peripheral artery disease. These searches were limited to studies, reviews, and other evidence conducted in human subjects and published in English.

Breet""]"	"High on-clopidogrel platelet reactivity (HCPR) and high on-aspirin platelet reactivity (HAPR) are associated with atherothrombotic events following coronary stenting. There are, however, few data concerning high on-treatment platelet reactivity to both aspirin and clopidogrel simultaneously. The aim of the present study was to determine the incidence of dual high on-treatment platelet reactivity (DAPR) and its impact on clinical outcome.On-treatment platelet reactivity was measured in parallel by ADP- and arachidonic acid-induced light transmittance aggregometry (LTA) (n=921) and the point-of-care VerifyNow system (P2Y12 and aspirin) (n=422) in patients on dual antiplatelet therapy undergoing elective stent implantation. HCPR and HAPR were established by receiver-operator characteristic curve analysis. The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause death, non-fatal acute myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis and ischaemic stroke at 1-year follow-up.The incidence of DAPR varied between 14.7% and 26.9% depending on the platelet function test used.

However, PPIs may inhibit CYP2C19, potentially reducing the effectiveness of clopidogrel.MethodsA randomized, open-label, 2-period, crossover study of healthy subjects (n = 160, age 18 to 55 years, homozygous for CYP2C19 extensive metabolizer genotype, confined, standardized diet) was conducted. Clopidogrel 75 mg with or without a PPI (dexlansoprazole 60 mg, lansoprazole 30 mg, esomeprazole 40 mg, or, as a positive control to maximize potential interaction and demonstrate assay sensitivity, omeprazole 80 mg) was given daily for 9 days. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics were assessed on days 9 and 10. Pharmacodynamic end-points were vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein P2Y12 platelet reactivity index, maximal platelet aggregation to 5 and 20 mmol/l adenosine diphosphate, and VerifyNow P2Y12 platelet response units.ResultsPharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic responses with omeprazole demonstrated assay sensitivity. The area under the curve for clopidogrel active metabolite decreased significantly with esomeprazole but not with dexlansoprazole or lansoprazole. Similarly, esomeprazole but not dexlansoprazole or lansoprazole significantly reduced the effect of clopidogrel on vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein platelet reactivity index. All PPIs decreased the peak plasma concentration of clopidogrel active metabolite (omeprazole > esomeprazole > lansoprazole > dexlansoprazole) and showed a corresponding order of potency for effects on maximal platelet aggregation and platelet response units.ConclusionsGeneration of clopidogrel active metabolite and inhibition of platelet function were reduced less by the coadministration of dexlansoprazole or lansoprazole with clopidogrel than by the coadministration of esomeprazole or omeprazole. These results suggest that the potential of PPIs to attenuate the efficacy of clopidogrel could be minimized by the use of dexlansoprazole or lansoprazole rather than esomeprazole or omeprazole.

All received once-daily 20 mg doses of E3810 or omeprazole for 7 days in a randomized crossover manner, with a 3-week washout period between the two trial phases. The parent drugs and their principal metabolites in plasma and urine were measured on days 1 and 7 after drug administration. The mean values for area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of omeprazole were 6.3- and 4.4-fold greater, whereas those of E3810 were 1.8- and 1.9-fold greater in poor metabolizers than in extensive metabolizers after the first and final doses, respectively. Although the mean AUC values for both drugs were significantly (p < 0.01 or p < 0.05) greater in poor metabolizers than in extensive metabolizers, the difference in the AUC between the two groups was smaller after E3810 than after omeprazole administration. The AUC of omeprazole tended to increase with the repeated doses in extensive metabolizers, whereas no such change was observed for E3810. The urinary excretions of the principal metabolite(s) of two proton pump inhibitors also reflected the data derived from plasma samples in relation to S-mephenytoin 4'-hydroxylation status. We conclude that the metabolism of two proton pump inhibitors is under coregulatory control of S-mephenytoin 4'-hydroxylase (CYP2C19), but that the magnitude of CYP2C19-mediated metabolism appears to differ between the two drugs. In contrast to omeprazole, the metabolism of E3810 is less saturable in extensive metabolizers during the repetitive dosings."

Data sources: Literature retrieval was accessed through PubMed (1980-January 2009), abstracts from 2008 American Heart Association and 2009 Society of Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions Scientific Sessions, and media press releases using the terms clopidogrel, proton pump inhibitors, cytochrome 2C19, genetic cytochrome P450 polymorphisms, and drug interaction. In addition, reference citations from publications identified in the search were reviewed. Study selection and data extraction: Relevant original research articles and review articles were evaluated. Articles were selected if they were published in English and focused on any of the key words or appeared to have substantial content addressing the drug interaction. Data synthesis: Recent attention has been placed on a potential interaction observed between clopidogrel and the widely used PPIs. Preliminary evidence suggests that omeprazole interacts with clopidogrel, reducing clopidogrel's antiplatelet effects as measured by various laboratory tests. Most data indicate that the interaction involves the competitive inhibition of the CYP2C19 isoenzyme. The interaction appears to be clinically significant, as several retrospective analyses have shown an increase in adverse cardiovascular outcomes when PPIs and clopidogrel are used concomitantly. However, this may not be a class effect. Conclusions: Available data suggest that omeprazole is the PPI most likely to have a significant interaction with clopidogrel. Further studies are needed to determine that an interaction between the other PPIs and clopidogrel does not exist. In situations in which both clopidogrel and a PPI are indicated, pantoprazole should be used since it is the PPI least likely to interact with clopidogrel."

In addition, they are routinely prescribed for the prevention of gastrointestinal bleeding in patients receiving a dual antiplatelet therapy consisting of clopidogrel and aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) after myocardial infarction or percutaneous coronary intervention and stenting. Because PPIs are given to these patients for long periods, there is a concern about the potential for clinically significant drug-drug interactions (DDIs) with concomitantly administered medications. Because PPIs give rise to profound and long-lasting elevation of intragastric pH, it is not surprising that they interfere with the absorption of concurrent medications. Drug solubility may be substantially reduced at neutral pH compared with acidic conditions. In this context, PPIs have been shown to reduce the bioavailability of many clinically relevant drugs (e.g. ketoconazole, atazanavir) by 50% or more compared with the control values. Soon after the introduction of omeprazole (a prototype PPI) into the market, it was reported that omeprazole was associated with 30% and 10% reductions in systemic clearance of diazepam and phenytoin, respectively. In vitro studies demonstrating the inhibitory effects of omeprazole on the metabolism of these drugs with human liver microsomes gave a mechanistic explanation for the DDIs. Numerous subsequent studies have been performed to investigate the DDI potential of PPIs associated with the metabolic inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme activities; however, most such attempts have failed to find clinically relevant results. Nevertheless, recent large-scale clinical trials have raised concerns about possible DDIs between PPIs and an antiplatelet drug, clopidogrel. It has been suggested that coadministration of PPIs with a dual antiplatelet therapy consisting of clopidogrel and aspirin may attenuate the anti-aggregation effects of those medications and augment the risk of cardiovascular ischaemic events. There is a possibility that PPIs may elicit detrimental effects by inhibiting CYP2C19-dominated metabolism of clopidogrel to its active metabolite. Further studies are urgently required to clarify the mechanism of this DDI and to explore new aspects of the DDI potential of PPIs."

Objective To evaluate the capability of multiple platelet function tests to predict clinical outcome. Design, Setting, and Patients Prospective, observational, single-center cohort study of 1069 consecutive patients taking clopidogrel undergoing elective coronary stent implantation between December 2005 and December 2007. On-treatment platelet reactivity was measured in parallel by light transmittance aggregometry, Verify Now P2Y12 and Platelet works assays, and the IMPACT-R and the platelet function analysis system (PFA-100) (with the Dade PFA collagen/adenosine diphosphate (ADP) cartridge and Innovance PFA P2Y). Cutoff values for high on-treatment platelet reactivity were established by receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis. Main Outcome Measurement The primary end point was defined as a composite of all-cause death, nonfatal acute myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, and ischemic stroke. The primary safety end point included TIMI (Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction) criteria major and minor bleeding. Results Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that at 1-year follow-up, the primary end point occurred more frequently in patients with high on-treatment platelet reactivity when assessed by light transmittance aggregometry (52 [11.7%; 95% confidence interval {CI}, 8.9%-15.0%] vs 36 [6.0%;95%CI, 4.2%-8.2%] P.001; n=1049),Verify Now (54 [13.3%; 95% CI, 10.2%-17.0%] vs 37 [5.7%; 95% CI, 4.1%-7.8%]P.001; n=1052), Platelet works (33 [12.6%; 95% CI, 8.8%-17.2%] vs 21 [6.1%;95% CI, 3.8%-9.2%] P=.005; n=606), and Innovance PFA P2Y (18 [12.2%; 95%CI; 7.4%-18.6%] vs 28 [6.3%; 95% CI, 4.3%-8.9%] P=.02; n=588).

Attenuating effects on platelet response to clopidogrel have been reported solely for the PPI omeprazole.

The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of different PPIs (pantoprazole, omeprazole, esomeprazole) on platelet response to clopidogrel in patients with previous coronary stent placement under chronic clopidogrel treatment. In a cross-sectional observational study, consecutive patients under clopidogrel maintenance treatment (n = 1,000) scheduled for a control coronary angiography were enrolled. Adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation (in AU*min) was measured with multiple electrode platelet aggregometry (MEA). From the entire study population, 268 (26.8%) patients were under PPI treatment at the time point of platelet function testing (pantoprazole, n = 162; omeprazole, n = 64; esomeprazole, n = 42).

Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) are believed to decrease the risk of such complications, though no randomized trial has proved this in patients receiving dual antiplatelet therapy. Recently, concerns have been raised about the potential for PPIs to blunt the efficacy of clopidogrel. Methods: We randomly assigned patients with an indication for dual antiplatelet therapy to receive clopidogrel in combination with either omeprazole or placebo, in addition to aspirin. The primary gastrointestinal end point was a composite of overt or occult bleeding, symptomatic gastroduodenal ulcers or erosions, obstruction, or perforation. The primary cardiovascular end point was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, revascularization, or stroke. The trial was terminated prematurely when the sponsor lost financing. Results: We planned to enroll about 5000 patients; a total of 3873 were randomly assigned and 3761 were included in analyses. In all, 51 patients had a gastrointestinal event; the event rate was 1.1% with omeprazole and 2.9% with placebo at 180 days (hazard ratio with omeprazole, 0.34, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.18 to 0.63; P<0.001). The rate of overt upper gastrointestinal bleeding was also reduced with omeprazole as compared with placebo (hazard ratio, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.03 to 0.56; P = 0.001). A total of 109 patients had a cardiovascular event, with event rates of 4.9% with omeprazole and 5.7% with placebo (hazard ratio with omeprazole, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.68 to 1.44; P = 0.96); high-risk subgroups did not show significant heterogeneity. The two groups did not differ significantly in the rate of serious adverse events, though the risk of diarrhea was increased with omeprazole. Conclusions: Among patients receiving aspirin and clopidogrel, prophylactic use of a PPI reduced the rate of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. There was no apparent cardiovascular interaction between clopidogrel and omeprazole, but our results do not rule out a clinically meaningful difference in cardiovascular events due to use of a PPI."

Clopidogrel, a thienopyridine, is a prodrug that is transformed in vivo to an active metabolite by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The genes encoding CYP enzymes are polymorphic. Recent data demonstrated patients carrying a genetic variant of CYP enzymes (e.g. CYP2C19) would have a higher rate of ischemic events than non-carriers due to an attenuation of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic responses to clopidogrel. Furthermore, concomitant gastrointestinal ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) is commonly prescribed to patients because of the increased risk of bleeding with dual antiplatelet therapy. PPIs are extensively metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and have been associated with decreased antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel.

Substantial heterogeneity was observed between studies (I(2) =35.6), which was partially explained by the study sample size: the pooled HR was higher among studies with a sample size <500 patients (HR =3.55; 95% CI 1.66 to 7.56) and lower among studies with a sample size >=500 (HR =1.06; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.26). CYP2C19*2 was associated with an increased risk of a stent thrombosis (HR =2.24; 95% CI 1.52 to 3.30). The gain-of-function allele, mainly CYP2C19*17, was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular events (HR =0.75; 95% CI 0.66 to 0.87) and a higher risk of major bleeding (HR =1.26; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.50).Not only CYP2C19 loss-of-function but also gain-of-function alleles should be considered to define the pharmacogenetic response to clopidogrel. The results question the relevance of the CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles in the prediction of major cardiovascular events beyond stent thrombosis in coronary patients treated with clopidogrel. The gain-of-function variant is associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular events but a higher risk of bleeding."

Clinical practice guidelines recommend combination therapy with proton pump inhibitors (PPI) and dual antiplatelet therapy to attenuate gastrointestinal bleeding risk. In addition, high on-treatment platelet reactivity has been associated with recurrent ischemic events. Whether or not the pharmacological interaction between clopidogrel and PPI, which results in diminished antiplatelet effect, adversely influences clinical efficacy is highly controversial and the subject of debate. Based on largely anecdotal post-hoc analyses, the U.S. Federal Drug Administration's and European Medicines Agency's recommendations discourage PPI use (particularly omeprazole) in patients treated with clopidogrel.

Methods: A comparative pharmacokinetic study with each PPI was designed as an open, randomized, and crossover study of 18 Japanese healthy volunteers who were classified into the homozygous, heterozygous extensive metabolizer and the poor metabolizer based on the CYP2C19 genotype determined by PCR-RFLP method. Each subject received a single oral dose of 20 mg omeprazole, 30 mg lansoprazole, or 20 mg sodium rabeprazole, with at least 1 week washout period between treatments. Plasma concentrations of PPIs and their metabolites were monitored until 12 h after medication. Results: Pharmacokinetic profiles of omeprazole and lansoprazole were well correlated with the CYP2C19 genotype. The heterozygous extensive metabolizer was slightly different from the homozygote, but there was no statistically significant difference. The CYP2C19 genotype dependence found for lansoprazole was not obvious compared with omeprazole. As for rabeprazole, the pharmacokinetic profile was independent of the CYP2C19 genotype.

In different populations three phenotypes have been identified: extensive metabolizers, poor metabolizers and individuals carrying one wild type and one mutant allele (het extensive metabolizers). Systemic exposure to the proton pump inhibitors as expressed by the AUC (area under the plasma level time profiles) is 5-12-times higher in poor metabolizers than in extensive metabolizers. As the pharmacodynamic response (elevation of intragastric pH) to the proton pump inhibitors is related directly to their AUC, a much higher pH can be monitored over 24 hr in poor metabolizers than in extensive metabolizers. Furthermore, clinical efficacy of all proton pump inhibitors depend on maintaining intragastric pH above certain threshold levels and significantly higher eradication rates of Helicobacter pylori have been observed in patients of the poor metabolizers and het extensive metabolizers phenotype if compared to extensive metabolizers. Likewise, limited data suggest that proton pump inhibitors-induced healing rates in gastro-oesophageal reflux disease are apparently higher in poor metabolizers/het extensive metabolizers than in extensive metabolizers of CYP2C19. Therefore initial genotyping for this enzyme and higher dosage in extensive metabolizers is likely to improve the clinical efficacy of proton pump inhibitors."

By showing that choices reflected both influences we could then test the purity of the ventral striatal BOLD signal as a model-free report.

Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies suggest that the right anterior superior parietal (r-aSPL) and the right posterior superior parietal lobule (r-pSPL) have opposite roles in triggering perceptual reversals. It has been proposed that these two areas are part of a hierarchical network whose dynamics determine perceptual switches. However, how these two parietal regions interact with each other and with the rest of the brain during bistable perception is not known. Here, we investigated such a model by recording brain activity using fMRI while participants viewed a bistable structure-from-motion stimulus. Using dynamic causal modeling (DCM), we found that resolving such perceptual ambiguity was specifically associated with reciprocal interactions between these parietal regions and V5/MT. Strikingly, the strength of bottom-up coupling between V5/MT to r-pSPL and from r-pSPL to r-aSPL predicted individual mean dominance duration. Our findings are consistent with a hierarchical predictive coding model of parietal involvement in bistable perception and suggest that visual information processing underlying spontaneous perceptual switches can be described as changes in connectivity strength between parietal and visual cortical regions.

Pearson"", ""R. van Ee"", ""R. Blake""]"	"When sensory input allows for multiple, competing perceptual interpretations, observers' perception can fluctuate over time, which is called bistable perception. Imaging studies in humans have revealed transient responses in a right-lateralized network in the frontal-parietal cortex (rFPC) around the time of perceptual transitions between interpretations, potentially reflecting the neural initiation of transitions. We investigated the role of this activity in male human observers, with specific interest in its relation to the temporal structure of transitions, which can be either instantaneous or prolonged by periods during which observers experience a mix of both perceptual interpretations. Using both bistable apparent motion and binocular rivalry, we show that transition-related rFPC activity is larger for transitions that last longer, suggesting that rFPC remains active as long as a transition lasts. We also replicate earlier findings that rFPC activity during binocular rivalry transitions exceeds activity during yoked transitions that are simulated using video replay. However, we show that this established finding holds only when perceptual transitions are replayed as instantaneous events. When replay, instead, depicts transitions with the actual durations reported during rivalry, yoked transitions and genuine rivalry transitions elicit equal activity. Together, our results are consistent with the view that at least a component of rFPC activation during bistable perception reflects a response to perceptual transitions, both real and yoked, rather than their cause. This component of activity could reflect the change in sensory experience and task demand that occurs during transitions, which fits well with the known role of these areas in attention and decision making."

Despite recent advances in understanding the neural processes underlying such perceptual rivalry, a key question has remained unresolved: Does perceptual rivalry result merely from local bistability of neural activity patterns in sensory stimulus representations, or do higher-order areas play a causal role by shifting inference and, thus, initiating perceptual changes? We used functional MRI to measure brain activity while human observers reported successive spontaneous changes in perceived direction for an ambiguous apparent motion stimulus. In a control condition, the individual sequences of spontaneous perceptual switches during bistability were replayed by using a disambiguated version of the stimulus. Greater activations during spontaneous compared with stimulus-driven switches were observed in inferior frontal cortex bilaterally. Subsequent chronometric analyses of event-related signal time courses showed that, relative to activations in motion-sensitive extrastriate visual cortex, right inferior frontal cortex activation occurred earlier during spontaneous than during stimulus-driven perceptual changes. The temporal precedence of right inferior frontal activations suggests that this region participates in initiating spontaneous switches in perception during constant physical stimulation. Our findings can thus be seen as a signature of when and where the brain ""makes up its mind"" about competing perceptual interpretations of a given sensory input pattern."

Visual phenomena leading to such multistable perception, where constant sensory input evokes different conscious percepts, are particularly useful for investigating the processes underlying perceptual awareness [1]. Understanding the role that high-level brain regions outside early visual cortex play in perceptual alternations could elucidate how top-down processes modulate conscious perception [2]. In two studies [3,4] published recently in Current Biology, different combinations of the present authors used repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to disrupt activity in human superior parietal cortex, and reported seemingly contradictory results [5] concerning the effect of disrupting the normal function of this area on bistable perception.

There is a large amount of unexplained variability between individuals in the rate of such spontaneous alternations in perception [2-5]. We hypothesized that variability in perceptual rivalry might be reflected in individual differences in brain structure, because brain structure can exhibit systematic relationships with an individual's cognitive experiences and skills [6-9]. To test this notion, we examined in a large group of individuals how cortical thickness, local gray-matter density, and local white-matter integrity correlate with individuals' alternation rate for a bistable, rotating structure-from-motion stimulus [10]. All of these macroscopic measures of brain structure consistently revealed that the structure of bilateral superior parietal lobes (SPL) could account for interindividual variability in perceptual alternation rate. Furthermore, we examined whether the bilateral SPL regions play a causal role in the rate of perceptual alternations by using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and found that transient disruption of these areas indeed decreases the rate of perceptual alternations. These findings demonstrate a direct relationship between structure of SPL and individuals' perceptual switch rate.Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

By using functional MRI in humans exposed to bistable viewing conditions, subjective visual perception was related to covariation of activity in multiple extrastriate ventral, parietal, and prefrontal cortical areas. The coordination of activity among these regions was not linked to external sensory or motor events; rather, it reflected internal changes in perception and varied in strength with the frequency of perceptual events, suggesting that functional interactions between visual and prefrontal cortex may contribute to conscious vision. Because similar cortical systems have been implicated in short-term memory and motor planning, the results also imply that related neural processes may underlie visual awareness and the organization of voluntary behavior contingent on sensory cues."

According to the striatal hypothesis, people decrease response thresholds by increasing activation from cortex to striatum, releasing the brain from inhibition. According to the STN hypothesis, people decrease response thresholds by decreasing activation from cortex to subthalamic nucleus (STN); a decrease in STN activity is likewise thought to release the brain from inhibition and result in responses that are fast but error-prone. To test these hypotheses-both of which may be true-we conducted two experiments on perceptual decision making in which we used cues to vary the demands for speed vs. accuracy. In both experiments, behavioral data and mathematical model analyses confirmed that instruction from the cue selectively affected the setting of response thresholds. In the first experiment we used ultra-high-resolution 7T structural MRI to locate the STN precisely. We then used 3T structural MRI and probabilistic tractography to quantify the connectivity between the relevant brain areas. The results showed that participants who flexibly change response thresholds (as quantified by the mathematical model) have strong structural connections between presupplementary motor area and striatum. This result was confirmed in an independent second experiment. In general, these findings show that individual differences in elementary cognitive tasks are partly driven by structural differences in brain connectivity.

Greater BOLD responses in frontoparietal cortex have been shown to be associated with endogenous perceptual transitions compared with ""replay"" transitions designed to closely match bistability in both perceptual quality and timing. It has remained controversial, however, whether this enhanced activity reflects causal influences of these regions on processing at the sensory level or, alternatively, an effect of stimulus differences that result in, for example, longer durations of perceptual transitions in bistable perception compared with replay conditions. Using a rotating Lissajous figure in an fMRI experiment on 15 human participants, we controlled for potential confounds of differences in transition duration and confirmed previous findings of greater activity in frontoparietal areas for transitions during bistable perception. In addition, we applied dynamic causal modeling to identify the neural model that best explains the observed BOLD signals in terms of effective connectivity.

To resolve this discrepancy, amnesic patients with either selective hippocampal damage or more extensive MTL damage were tested on variations of an object discrimination task adapted from the nonhuman primate literature. Although both groups were equally impaired on standard recall-based memory tasks, they exhibited different profiles of performance on the object discrimination test, arguing against a unitary view of MTL function. Cases with selective hippocampal damage performed normally, whereas individuals with broader MTL lesions were impaired. Furthermore, deficits in this latter group were related not to the number of discriminations to be learned and remembered, but to the degree of ""feature ambiguity,"" a property of visual discriminations that can emerge when features are part of both rewarded and unrewarded stimuli.

A large-scale brain network, referred to as the default mode network (DMN), has been shown to be involved in both mind-wandering and reading, raising the question as to how the same neural system could be implicated in processes with both costs and benefits to narrative comprehension. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) was used to explore whether the intrinsic functional connectivity of the two key midline hubs of the DMN-the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and anterior medial prefrontal cortex (aMPFC)-was predictive of individual differences in reading comprehension and task focus recorded outside of the scanner. Worse comprehension was associated with greater functional connectivity between the PCC and a region of the ventral striatum. Better comprehension was associated with greater functional connectivity with a region of the right insula. By contrast reports of increasing task focus were associated with functional connectivity from the aMPFC to clusters in the PCC, the left parietal and temporal cortex, and the cerebellum. Our results suggest that the DMN has both costs (such as poor comprehension) and benefits to reading (such as an on-task focus) because its midline core can couple its activity with other regions to form distinct functional communities that allow seemingly opposing mental states to occur.

Unlike most previous research that focused on the relationship between rs-fcMRI and a single behavioral measure of EF, in the current study we examined the relationship of rs-fcMRI with individual differences in subcomponents of EF. Ninety-one adults completed a resting state fMRI scan and three separate EF tasks outside the magnet: inhibition of prepotent responses, task set shifting, and working memory updating. From these three measures, we derived estimates of common aspects of EF, as well as abilities specific to working memory updating and task shifting. Using Independent Components Analysis (ICA), we identified across the group of participants several networks of regions (Resting State Networks, RSNs) with temporally correlated time courses. We then used dual regression to explore how these RSNs covaried with individual differences in EF. Dual regression revealed that increased higher common EF was associated with connectivity of a) frontal pole with an attentional RSN, and b) Crus I and II of the cerebellum with the right frontoparietal RSN. Moreover, higher shifting-specific abilities were associated with increased connectivity of angular gyrus with a ventral attention RSN. The results of the current study suggest that the organization of the brain at rest may have important implications for individual differences in EF, and that individuals higher in EF may have expanded resting state networks as compared to individuals with lower EF.

Recent studies have demonstrated the existence of a number of highly connected and highly central neocortical hub regions, regions that play a key role in global information integration between different parts of the network. The potential functional importance of these Òbrain hubsÓ is underscored by recent studies showing that disturbances of their structural and functional connectivity profile are linked to neuropathology. This study aims to map out both the subcortical and neocortical hubs of the brain and examine their mutual relationship, particularly their structural linkages. Here, we demonstrate that brain hubs form a so-called Òrich club,Ó characterized by a tendency for high-degree nodes to be more densely connected among themselves than nodes of a lower degree, providing important information on the higher-level topology of the brain network. Whole-brain structural networks of 21 subjects were reconstructed using diffusion tensor imaging data. Examining the connectivity profile of these networks revealed a group of 12 strongly interconnected bihemispheric hub regions, comprising the precuneus, superior frontal and superior parietal cortex, as well as the subcortical hippocampus, putamen, and thalamus. Importantly, these hub regions were found to be more densely interconnected than would be expected based solely on their degree, together forming a rich club.

Although effects of reward-or value in general-on perception therefore seem likely, how valuation modulates perception and how such modulation relates to attention is largely unknown. We probed effects of reward on perception by using a binocular-rivalry paradigm. Distinct gratings drifting in opposite directions were presented to each observer's eyes. To objectify their subjective perceptual experience, the optokinetic nystagmus was used as measure of current perceptual dominance. In a first experiment, one of the percepts was either rewarded or attended. We found that reward and attention similarly biased perception. In a second experiment, observers performed an attentionally demanding task either on the rewarded stimulus, the other stimulus, or both. We found that-on top of an attentional effect on perception-at each level of attentional load, reward still modulated perception by increasing the dominance of the rewarded percept. Similarly, penalizing one percept increased dominance of the other at each level of attentional load. In turn, rewarding-and similarly nonpunishing-a percept yielded performance benefits that are typically associated with selective attention. In conclusion, our data show that value modulates perception in a similar way as the volitional deployment of attention, even though the relative effect of value is largely unaffected by an attention task.

These bistable perceptual phenomena provide a unique window into the neural mechanisms that create the contents of conscious perception. Models of bistable perception posit that mutual inhibition between stimulus-selective neural populations in visual cortex plays a key role in these spontaneous perceptual fluctuations. However, a direct link between neural inhibition and bistable perception has not yet been established experimentally. Here, we link perceptual dynamics in three distinct bistable visual illusions (binocular rivalry, motion-induced blindness, and structure from motion) to measurements of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) concentrations in human visual cortex (as measured with magnetic resonance spectroscopy) and to pharmacological stimulation of the GABAA receptor by means of lorazepam. As predicted by a model of neural interactions underlying bistability, both higher GABA concentrations in visual cortex and lorazepam administration induced slower perceptual dynamics, as reflected in a reduced number of perceptual switches and a lengthening of percept durations. Thus, we show that GABA, the main inhibitory neurotransmitter, shapes the dynamics of bistable perception.

Visser"", ""E. Jefferies"", ""M. A. Lambon Ralph""]"	"The role of the anterior temporal lobes (ATLs) in semantic cognition is not clear from the current literature. Semantic dementia patients show a progressive and a specific semantic impairment, following bilateral atrophy of the ATLs. Neuroimaging studies of healthy participants, however, do not consistently show ATL activation during semantic tasks. Consequently, several influential theories of semantic memory do not ascribe a central role to the ATLs. We conducted a meta-analysis of 164 functional neuroimaging studies of semantic processing to investigate factors that might contribute to the inconsistency in previous results. Four factors influenced the likelihood of finding ATL activation: (1) the use of PET versus fMRI, reflecting the fact that fMRI but not PET is sensitive to distortion artifacts caused by large variations in magnetic susceptibility in the area of the ATL; (2) a field of view (FOV) of more than 15 cm, thereby ensuring whole-brain coverage; (3) the use of a high baseline task to prevent subtraction of otherwise uncontrolled semantic activation; (4) the inclusion of the ATL as an ROI. The type of stimuli or task did not influence the likelihood of ATL activation, consistent with the view that this region underpins an amodal semantic system. Spoken words, written words, and picture stimuli produced overlapping ATL peaks. On average, these were more inferior for picture-based tasks. We suggest that the specific pattern of ATL activation may be influenced by stimulus type due to variations across this region in the degree of connectivity with modality-specific areas in posterior temporal cortex."

Schooler""]"	"The mind flows in a ""stream of consciousness,"" which often neglects immediate sensory input in favor of focusing on intrinsic, self-generated thoughts or images. Although considerable research has documented the disruptive influences of task-unrelated thought for perceptual processing and task performance, the brain dynamics associated with these phenomena are not well understood. Here we investigate the possibility, suggested by several convergent lines of research, that task-unrelated thought is associated with a reduction in the trial-to-trial phase consistency of the oscillatory neural signal in response to perceptual input. Using an experience sampling paradigm coupled with continuous high-density electroencephalography, we observed that task-unrelated thought was associated with a reduction of the P1 ERP, replicating prior observations that mind-wandering is accompanied by a reduction of the brain-evoked response to sensory input. Time-frequency analysis of the oscillatory neural response revealed a decrease in theta-band cortical phase-locking, which peaked over parietal scalp regions. Furthermore, we observed that task-unrelated thought impacted the oscillatory mode of the brain during the initiation of a task-relevant action, such that more cortical processing was required to meet task demands. Together, these findings document that the attenuation of perceptual processing that occurs during task-unrelated thought is associated with a reduction in the temporal fidelity with which the brain responds to a stimulus and suggest that increased neural processing may be required to recouple attention to a task.

We decomposed NYC-Q scores using exploratory factor analysis and found that self-reported thoughts clustered into distinct dimensions of content (future related, past related, positive, negative, and social) and form (words, images, and specificity). We used these components to perform an individual difference analysis exploring how differences in the types of self-generated thoughts relate to whole brain measures of intrinsic brain activity (fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations, regional homogeneity, and degree centrality). We found patterns of self-generated thoughts related to changes that were distributed across a wide range of cortical areas. For example, individuals who reported greater imagery exhibited greater low frequency fluctuations in a region of perigenual cingulate cortex, a region that is known to participate in the so-called default-mode network. We also found certain forms of thought were associated with other areas, such as primary visual cortex, the insula, and the cerebellum. For example, individuals who reported greater future thought exhibited less homogeneous neural fluctuations in a region of lateral occipital cortex, a result that is consistent with the claim that particular types of self-generated thought depend on processes that are decoupled from sensory processes. These data provide evidence that self-generated thought is a heterogeneous category of experience and that studying its content can be helpful in understanding brain dynamics."

A potential solution is to register experiments prior to data acquisition and analysis. In this study we attempted to replicate studies that relate brain structure to behavior and cognition. These structural brain-behavior (SBB) correlations occasionally receive much attention in science and in the media. Given the impact of these studies, it is important to investigate their replicability. Here, we attempt to replicate five SBB correlation studies comprising a total of 17 effects. To prevent the impact of QRPs we employed a preregistered, purely confirmatory replication approach.

Many different automatic registration methods have been proposed to date, and almost all share a common mathematical framework - one of optimising a cost function. To date little attention has been focused on the optimisation method itself, even though the success of most registration methods hinges on the quality of this optimisation. This paper examines the assumptions underlying the problem of registration for brain images using inter-modal voxel similarity measures. It is demonstrated that the use of local optimisation methods together with the standard multi-resolution approach is not sufficient to reliably find the global minimum. To address this problem, a global optimisation method is proposed that is specifically tailored to this form of registration. A full discussion of all the necessary implementation details is included as this is an important part of any practical method. Furthermore, results are presented for inter-modal, inter-subject registration experiments that show that the proposed method is more reliable at finding the global minimum than several of the currently available registration packages in common usage."

"[""Olivia L Carter"", ""John D Pettigrew""]"	"Perceptual rivalry is an oscillation of conscious experience that takes place despite univarying. if ambiguous, sensory input. Much current interest is focused on the controversy over the neural site of binocular rivalry, a variety of perceptual rivalry for which a number of different cortical regions have been implicated. Debate continues over the relative role of higher levels of processing compared with primary visual cortex and the suggestion that different forms of rivalry involve different cortical areas. Here we show that the temporal pattern of disappearance and reappearance in motion-induced blindness (MIB) (Bonneh et al, 2001 Nature 411 798-801) is highly correlated with the pattern of oscillation reported during binocular rivalry in the same individual. This correlation holds over a wide range of inter-individual variation. Temporal similarity in the two phenomena was strikingly confirmed by the effects of the hallucinogen LSD, which produced the same, extraordinary, pattern of increased rhythmicity in both kinds of perceptual oscillation. Furthermore. MIB demonstrates the two properties previously considered characteristic of binocular rivalry. Namely the distribution of dominance periods can be approximated by a gamma distribution and, in line with Levelt's second proposition of binocular rivalry, predominance of one perceptual phase can be increased through a reduction in the predominance time of the opposing phase. We conclude that (i) MIB is a form of perceptual rivalry, and (ii) there may be a common oscillator responsible for timing aspects of all forms of perceptual rivalry."

CCT146	30272741	Brain networks underlying bistable perception	Daniel Baker	Right parietal TMS shortens dominance durations in binocular rivalry	"[""David Carmel"", ""Vincent Walsh"", ""Nilli Lavie"", ""Geraint Rees""]"	"Binocular rivalry occurs when dissimilar images are presented to each eye. Rather than a combined picture being perceived, each monocular image competes for perceptual dominance, becoming visible for a few seconds while the other is suppressed. Stable visual input thus leads to alternations in conscious perception, dissociating stimulation from awareness. This makes rivalry particularly useful for elucidating the neural processes underlying consciousness [1]. Retinotopic visual cortex [2] and lateral geniculate nucleus [3] activity are modulated by such alternating perception, implying an early locus for rivaling neural representations. However, higher cortical regions, including right superior parietal cortex, exhibit activity that is time-locked to perceptual transitions [4]. Though this implies the involvement of top-down processes in rivalry, the correlational nature of neuroimaging precludes the attribution of a causal role to such activity, which may instead simply reflect orientating attention to the transition. Here we distinguish these two hypotheses by showing that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over right superior parietal cortex shortened binocular rivalry dominance durations. This suggests that right parietal cortex maintains the current perceptual state during rivalry.Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Krienen""]"	The human cerebral cortex is vastly expanded relative to other primates and disproportionately occupied by distributed association regions. Here we offer a hypothesis about how association networks evolved their prominence and came to possess circuit properties vital to human cognition. The rapid expansion of the cortical mantle may have untethered large portions of the cortex from strong constraints of molecular gradients and early activity cascades that lead to sensory hierarchies. What fill the gaps between these hierarchies are densely interconnected networks that widely span the cortex and mature late into development. Limitations of the tethering hypothesis are discussed as well as its broad implications for understanding critical features of the human brain as a byproduct of size scaling.

The concept of Information Quality (InfoQ) is defined by Kenett and Shmueli as the potential of a dataset to achieve a specific (scientific or practical) goal using a given data analysis method. Eight dimensions help assess the level of InfoQ of a study. These are: Data Resolution, Data Structure, Data Integration, Temporal Relevance, Generalizability, Chronology of Data and Goal, Operationalization, and Communication. This paper shows with examples, how combining graphical analysis with Bayesian analysis in the form of Bayesian networks generates high InfoQ.

Kurowicka"", ""R. M. Cooke""]"	"Bayesian belief nets (BBNs) have become a popular tool for specifying high-dimensional probabilistic models. Commercial tools with an advanced graphical user interface that support BBNs construction and inference are available. Thus, building and working with BBNs is very efficient as long as one is not forced to quantify complex BBNs. A high assessment burden of discrete BBNs is often caused by the discretization of continuous variables. Until recently, continuous BBNs were restricted to the joint normal distribution. We present the ÔcopulaÐvineÕ approach to continuous BBNs. This approach is quite general and allows traceable and defendable quantification methods, but it comes at a price: these BBNs must be evaluated by Monte Carlo simulation. Updating such a BBN requires re-sampling the whole structure. The advantages of fast updating algorithms for discrete BBNs are decisive. A hybrid method advanced here samples the continuous BBN once, and then discretizes this so as to enable fast updating. This combines the reduced assessment burden and modelling flexibility of the continuous BBNs with the fast updating algorithms of discrete BBNs.

The motivation of this work is the recent experimental realization of this system at National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) where the placement of atoms in an optical lattice is controlled by using an intermediate superlattice. Under the 2PI CTP scheme with this initial configuration, three different approximations are considered: a) the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) approximation, b) the next-to-leading order 1/_ expansion of the 2PI effective action up to second order in the interaction strength and c) a second order perturbative expansion in the interaction strength. We present detailed comparisons between these approximations and determine their range of validity by contrasting them with the exact many body solution for a moderate number of atoms and wells. As a general feature we observe that because the second order 2PI approximations include multi-particle scattering in a systematic way, they are able to capture damping effects exhibited in the exact solution that a mean field collisionless approach fails to produce.

Fisher""]"	"The phase diagrams and phase transitions of bosons with short-ranged repulsive interactions moving in periodic and/or random external potentials at zero temperature are investigated with emphasis on the superfluid-insulator transition induced by varying a parameter such as the density. Bosons in periodic potentials (e.g., on a lattice) at T=0 exhibit two types of phases: a superfluid phase and Mott insulating phases characterized by integer (or commensurate) boson densities, by the existence of a gap for particle-hole excitations, and by zero compressibility. Generically, the superfluid onset transition in d dimensions from a Mott insulator to superfluidity is ''ideal,'' or mean field in character, but at special multicritical points with particle-hole symmetry it is in the universality class of the (d+1)-dimensional XY model. In the presence of disorder, a third, ''Bose glass'' phase exists. This phase is insulating because of the localization effects of the randomness and analogous to the Fermi glass phase of interacting fermions in a strongly disordered potential. The Bose glass phase is characterized by a finite compressibility, no gap, but an infinite superfluid susceptibility. In the presence of disorder the transition to superfluidity is argued to occur only from the Bose glass phase, and never directly from the Mott insulator. This zero-temperature superfluid-insulator transition is studied via generalizations of the Josephson scaling relation for the superfluid density at the ordinary l transition, highlighting the crucial role of quantum fluctuations. The transition is found to have a dynamic critical exponent z exactly equal to d and correlation length and order-parameter correlation exponents n and e which satisfy the bounds n>=2/d and e<=2-d, respectively. It is argued that the superfluid-insulator transition in the presence of disorder may have an upper critical dimension dc which is infinite, but a perturbative renormalization-group calculation wherein the critical exponents have mean-field values for weak disorder above d=4 is also discussed. Many of these conclusions are verified by explicit calculations on a model of one-dimensional bosons in the presence of both random and periodic potentials. The general results are applied to experiments on 4He absorbed in porous media such as Vycor. Some measurable properties of the superfluid onset are predicted exactly [e.g., the exponent x relating the l transition temperature to the zero-temperature superfluid density is found to be d/2(d-1)], while stringent bounds are placed on others.

Nevertheless, the matter wave field has a quantized structure owing to the granularity of the discrete underlying atoms. Although such a field is usually assumed to be intrinsically stable (apart from incoherent loss processes), this is no longer true when the condensate is in a coherent superposition of different atom number states. For example, in a Bose-Einstein condensate confined by a three-dimensional optical lattice, each potential well can be prepared in a coherent superposition of different atom number states, with constant relative phases between neighbouring lattice sites. It is then natural to ask how the individual matter wave fields and their relative phases evolve. Here we use such a set-up to investigate these questions experimentally, observing that the matter wave field of the Bose-Einstein condensate undergoes a periodic series of collapses and revivals; this behaviour is directly demonstrated in the dynamical evolution of the multiple matter wave interference pattern.

We observe Mott-insulating plateaus with near-zero entropy and clearly resolve the high-entropy rings separating them, even though their width is of the order of just a single lattice site. Furthermore, we show how a Mott insulator melts with increasing temperature, owing to a proliferation of local defects. The ability to resolve individual lattice sites directly opens up new avenues for the manipulation, analysis and applications of strongly interacting quantum gases on a lattice.

Recent excavations, which began in 1997, have exposed an 18 m archaeological sequence that covered the last evidence of Neanderthal occupation and the first evidence of modern human occupation in the cave. By applying the Mutual Climatic Range method on the amphibian and reptile assemblages, we propose here new quantitative data on the terrestrial climatic conditions throughout the latest Pleistocene sequence of GorhamÕs Cave. In comparison with current climatic data, all mean annual temperatures were about 1.6-1.8 degrees C lower in this region. Winters were colder and summers were similar to today. Mean annual precipitation was slightly lower, but according to the Aridity Index of Gaussen there were only four dry months during the latest Pleistocene as opposed to five dry months today during the summer. The climate was Mediterranean and semi-arid (according to the Aridity Index of Dantin-Revenga) or semi-humid (according to the Aridity Index of Martonne). The atmospheric temperature range was higher during the latest Pleistocene, mainly due to lower winter temperatures. Such data support recent bioclimatic models, which indicate that high rainfall levels may have been a significant factor in the late survival of Neanderthal populations in southern Iberia. The Solutrean levels of GorhamÕs Cave and climate records from cores in the Alboran Sea indicate increasing aridity from Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3-2.

Conard""]"	"The German site of Geissenklosterle is crucial to debates concerning the European Middle to Upper Palaeolithic transition and the origins of the Aurignacian in Europe. Previous dates from the site are central to an important hypothesis, the Kulturpumpe model, which posits that the Swabian Jura was an area where crucial behavioural developments took place and then spread to other parts of Europe. The previous chronology (critical to the model), is based mainly on radiocarbon dating, but remains poorly constrained due to the dating resolution and the variability of dates. The cause of these problems is disputed, but two principal explanations have been proposed: a) larger than expected variations in the production of atmospheric radiocarbon, and b) taphonomic influences in the site mixing the bones that were dated into different parts of the site. We reinvestigate the chronology using a new series of radiocarbon determinations obtained from the Mousterian, Aurignacian and Gravettian levels. The results strongly imply that the previous dates were affected by insufficient decontamination of the bone collagen prior to dating. Using an ultrafiltration protocol the chronometric picture becomes much clearer. Comparison of the results against other recently dated sites in other parts of Europe suggests the Early Aurignacian levels are earlier than other sites in the south of France and Italy, but not as early as recently dated sites which suggest a pre-Aurignacian dispersal of modern humans to Italy by ~45000 cal BP. They are consistent with the importance of the Danube Corridor as a key route for the movement of people and ideas. The new dates fail to refute the Kulturpumpe model and suggest that Swabian Jura is a region that contributed significantly to the evolution of symbolic behaviour as indicated by early evidence for figurative art, music and mythical imagery."

A detailed geological reconstruction of The Netherlands' south-west offshore area provides a stratigraphical context for archaeological and palaeontological finds. Progressive environmental developments have left a strong imprint on the area's Palaeolithic record. We highlight aspects of landscape evolution and related taphonomical changes, visualized in maps for critical periods of the Pleistocene in the wider southern North Sea region. The Middle Pleistocene record is divided into two palaeogeographical stages: the pre-Anglian/Elsterian stage, during which a wide land bridge existed between England and Belgium even during marine highstands; and the Anglian/Elsterian to Saalian interglacial, with a narrower land bridge, lowered by proglacial erosion but not yet fully eroded. The Late Pleistocene landscape was very different, with the land bridge fully dissected by an axial Rhine-Thames valley, eroded deep enough to fully connect the English Channel and the North Sea during periods of highstand. This tripartite staging implies great differences in (i) possible migration routes of herds of herbivores as well as hominins preying upon them, (ii) the erosion base of axial and tributary rivers causing an increase in the availability of flint raw materials and (iii) conditions for loess accumulation in northern France and Belgium and the resulting preservation of Middle Palaeolithic sites.

Golledge""]"	"The volume of research dedicated to uncovering cognitive information about urban environments is rapidly growing, although this Work is still in its infancy. A number of critical problems remain to be solved and their solutions widely accepted before the results of these investigations can be incorporated into existing theory or can be converted to practical use. The purpose of this paper is to discuss methods of representing cognitive information in such a way that it can be objectively verified, to suggest analytical procedures for interpreting the representations so obtained, and to suggest a range of activities which may profit from the use of cognitive representations. Throughout the course of the discussion, reference will be made to a recent project in the city of Columbus, Ohio. REPRESENTING COGNIZED ENVIRONMENTS While it is a matter of definition that cognitive information is peculiar to each individual, abundant evidence indicates that most people share recognition of many external cues. Although external reality is filtered thrbugh the senses by a person's unique cognitive transformation processes, communication about what is being processed is necessarily tied into language, verbal or otherwise. This information is transmitted on an interpersonal basis by referring the cognitively processed bits of information to acceptable conceptual schemas and communicable descriptive terms. Awareness of phenomenon external to mind can be generated by any of our senses, and differences of opinion as to what is sending messages or what may be said to actually occur in an environment may arise when different senses are used in the information-extraction process, when physiological qualities of the senses differ among the observers, when different transactional modes are used to elicit information, where the observer's locations vary, or where values, ethics, and mores of individual observers differ. Consequently, before one can make statements about representing cognitive information about an external environment, it is critical to become aware of what environment is being sensed and what skills or senses the receptor individual is using to filter the mass of ""to-whom-it-may-concern"" messages that emanate from phenomenon outside of mind.

"[""Gerd Gigerenzer"", ""Daniel G. Goldstein""]"	"Humans and animals make inferences about the world under limited time and knowledge. In contrast, many models of rational inference treat the mind as a Laplacean Demon, equipped with unlimited time, knowledge, and computational might. Following H. Simon's notion of satisfying, the authors have proposed a family of algorithms based on a simple psychological mechanism: one-reason decision making. These fast and frugal algorithms violate fundamental tenets of classical rationality: They neither look up nor integrate all information. By computer simulation, the authors held a competition between the satisfying ""Take The Best"" algorithm and various ""rational"" inference procedures (e.g., multiple regression). The Take The Best algorithm matched or outperformed all competitors in inferential speed and accuracy. This result in an existence proof that cognitive mechanisms capable of successful performance in the real world do not need to satisfy the classical norms of rational inference."

Traditional models of unbounded rationality and optimization in cognitive science, economics, and animal behavior have tended to view decision-makers as possessing supernatural powers of reason, limitless knowledge, and endless time. But understanding decisions in the real world requires a more psychologically plausible notion of bounded rationality. In Simple heuristics that make us smart (Gigerenzer et al. 1999), we explore fast and frugal heuristics--simple rules in the mind's adaptive toolbox for making decisions with realistic mental resources. These heuristics can enable both living organisms and artificial systems to make smart choices quickly and with a minimum of information by exploiting the way that information is structured in particular environments. In this precis, we show how simple building blocks that control information search, stop search, and make decisions can be put together to form classes of heuristics, including: ignorance-based and one-reason decision making for choice, elimination models for categorization, and satisficing heuristics for sequential search. These simple heuristics perform comparably to more complex algorithms, particularly when generalizing to new data--that is, simplicity leads to robustness. We present evidence regarding when people use simple heuristics and describe the challenges to be addressed by this research program."

Accounts of people surviving and even thriving in peripheral areas are often instrumental to construct and maintain the dichotomy between 'the desert and the sown.' It is sometimes stated that mobile peoples obtain their material culture from neighboring settled populations, rather than produce their own, and that they do not leave recognizable archaeological traces apart from 'ephemeral campsites.' From the 24 chapters in this volume, however, it is clear that there is indeed an 'archaeology of mobility.'By applying specific and well-defined methods, it is eminently possible to come to a better understanding of mobile people in archaeological contexts. Such an archaeology of mobility encompasses much more than tracing ephemeral campsites. Much like any other group, mobile people produce, appear to use and discard a distinct material culture which includes functional objects, art and architecture. There have been edited books on the archaeology of nomadism in various regions, and there have been individual archaeological and anthropological monographs, but nothing with the kind of coverage provided in this volume. Its strength and importance lie in the fact that it brings together a world-wide collection of studies of the archaeology of mobility.This book provides a ready-made reference to this world-wide phenomenon and is unique in that it tries to redefine pastoralism within a larger context by the term mobility.

Initially we discuss the nature of cognitive maps and the process of cognitive mapping as mechanisms for developing person to object (egocentric) and object to object (allocentric) internal representations. Imperfections in encoding either relations can introduce imperfections in representations of environments in memory. This, together with individual differences in human spatial abilities, can result in data manipulations that produce error. When information stored in long term memory is brought into working memory for purposes of decision making and choice behavior (as in route selection), the result may be the selection of an inefficient or incorrect path. We explore the connection between environmental learning and cognitive maps in the context of learning a route in two different cultural environments-Belfast (Northern Ireland) and Santa Barbara (California). Blind, vision impaired, and sighted volunteers traveled and learned routes of approximately the same length (1.2miles) in their respective urban environments. An initial trial was experimenter guided; three following trials were regarded as ""test"" trials where the participants learned the route and performed route fixing tasks including pointing between designated places, verbally describing the route after each completion, and building a model of the route using metallic strips on a magnetic board. Results indicated that by the end of the third test trial, and using the reinforcing strategies, the results of the blind or vision impaired participants could not be statistically differentiated from those of the sighted participants. This indicated that the wayfinding abilities of the three groups were equivalent in this experiment and suggested that spatial abilities were potentially the same in each group but that lack of sight interfered with putting knowledge into action"	"To begin with, if we accept the two-phase dispersal model of Aurignacian technologies, with a pioneer and a consolidated phase reflected in different sociocultural signatures (Davies 2001(Davies , 2007, the conditions of landscape knowledge and learning deserve special attention (e.g., #AUTHOR_TAG 2003;Kelly 2003)."

Such patterns necessarily comprise many interacting locales, and it is at the landscape scale that we should attempt to understand the relationship between ethnographic and archeological data. This paper derives, quantifies and tests a series of basic predictions about the effects of group size, occupation duration and habitat quality on mobility strategies using a substantial ethnographic dataset. The results demonstrate that habitat quality is the best determinant of move distances among hunter-gatherers, but that occupation duration also has an effect among those foragers who rely principally on hunting. It is suggested that three roughly concentric zones, the limit of scatter, the foraging radius, and the logistic radius, are predicted by group size and occupation duration, habitat quality, and proportions of hunting and logistical mobility, respectively. The relevance of these conclusions to more generic ecological theory is discussed in the context of evolutionary forces acting on hunter-gatherer mobility in prehistory."

In both studies, sexism was positively associated with essentialism only among men and only when inequality was presented as changing. Study 3 (N = 552) explored the possible consequences of expressing essentialist theories for social change. Exposure to essentialist theories increased both men's and women's acceptance of inequality. Exposure further increased men's support for discriminatory practices and boosted their self-esteem.

The patients were randomly assigned to either arthroscopic treatment followed by exercise therapy for 2 months or to the same exercise therapy alone. At the start of the study and at the follow-ups at 24 and 60 months the patients answered three questionnaires KOOS, Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale and Tegner Activity Scale and made pain ratings on the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).Both groups showed highly significant clinical improvements from baseline to the follow-ups at 24 and 60 months on all subscales of KOOS, Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale and VAS (p < 0.0001). No group differences were found at any of the testing occasions. One third of the patients that were treated with exercise therapy alone did not feel better after the treatment but were improved after arthroscopic surgery. According to radiographic findings two patients from each group had a slight progression of their osteoarthritis after 5 years.The findings indicate that arthroscopic surgery followed by exercise therapy was not superior to the same exercise therapy alone for this type of patients.

Meniscus damage might be considered a signifying feature of incipient OA in middle-aged and elderly people. As approximately every third knee of people in these groups has a damaged meniscus, tears are common incidental findings of knee MRI. However, as most tears do not cause symptoms, careful clinical evaluation is required to determine if a damaged meniscus is likely to directly impact a patient's symptoms. Conservative management of patients with knee pain and a degenerative meniscal tear should be considered as a first-line therapy before surgical treatment is contemplated. Patients with mechanical interference of joint movements, such as painful catching or locking, might need surgical treatment with meniscal repair if possible. In a subset of patients, meniscal resection might relieve pain and other symptoms that potentially originate directly from the torn meniscus.

METHODS We conducted a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial involving symptomatic patients 45 years of age or older with a meniscal tear and evidence of mild-to-moderate osteoarthritis on imaging. We randomly assigned 351 patients to surgery and postoperative physical therapy or to a standardized physical-therapy regimen (with the option to cross over to surgery at the discretion of the patient and surgeon). The patients were evaluated at 6 and 12 months. The primary outcome was the difference between the groups with respect to the change in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) physical-function score (ranging from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms) 6 months after randomization. RESULTS In the intention-to-treat analysis, the mean improvement in the WOMAC score after 6 months was 20.9 points (95% confidence interval [CI], 17.9 to 23.9) in the surgical group and 18.5 (95% CI, 15.6 to 21.5) in the physical-therapy group (mean difference, 2.4 points; 95% CI, _1.8 to 6.5). At 6 months, 51 active participants in the study who were assigned to physical therapy alone (30%) had undergone surgery, and 9 patients assigned to surgery (6%) had not undergone surgery. The results at 12 months were similar to those at 6 months. The frequency of adverse events did not differ significantly between the groups. CONCLUSIONS In the intention-to-treat analysis, we did not find significant differences between the study groups in functional improvement 6 months after randomization; however, 30% of the patients who were assigned to physical therapy alone underwent surgery within 6 months.

We then qualitatively synthesized these observations across multiple studies. Twenty-five studies met our criteria for inclusion. Eight of the studies had a prospective design. There were no randomized, controlled trials. The studies had important methodological limitations. Greater size of meniscal resection and female gender showed the strongest and most consistent associations with greater radiographic evidence of osteoarthritis across multiple studies. Greater articular cartilage degeneration assessed at surgery, greater size of meniscal resection, greater laxity of the anterior cruciate ligament, and prior surgery on the index knee were the strongest predictors of worse functional outcomes. Patients with worse preoperative health status (SF-36 score <60), Workers' Compensation, and pending litigation had worse functional outcomes, but these factors were examined in only 1 study.

This information will then be used to plan a clinical trial investigating the effects of rehabilitation following arthroscopic meniscectomy. Knee extensor and flexor strength was evaluated at four different velocities (60, 120, 180, and 240 degrees/sec) preoperatively and every 2 weeks from weeks 2-12 postsurgery. Eight subjects were evaluated on a Cybex II+ and 14 subjects were evaluated on a Cybex II isokinetic device. A repeated measures analysis of variance was used to determine possible side (involved and uninvolved), speed (60, 120, 180, and 240 degrees/sec), or time (preoperative, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 weeks postoperatively) effects as well as possible interactions between these factors. Prior to partial meniscectomy, the involved quadriceps was significantly weaker than the uninvolved quadriceps only at 60 degrees/sec (15%). A further decrease in torque was noted at 2 (25-40% deficit depending on the velocity) and 4 weeks postsurgery at all speeds (17-25%). The quadriceps recovered to preoperative values by 4-6 weeks postsurgery and stabilized at this level until the end of the study, at which time the quadriceps remained weaker than the contralateral side at 60 degrees/sec (14%) and 120 degrees/sec (12%). Prior to surgery, the involved hamstrings were comparable with the uninvolved hamstrings. Although significant differences between sides were found at week 2 postsurgery at 60 (23%) and 120 degrees/sec (17%), the hamstrings were fully recovered by 4 weeks postoperatively. In conclusion, although the quadriceps may recover to preoperative levels by 4-6 weeks following partial meniscectomy, further recovery does not appear to be possible without training as the quadriceps remains weaker than the contralateral side up to 12 weeks postsurgery."

The specific locomotor adaptations related to large strength deficits were also studied. The results indicate that large deficits were significantly associated to: 1) reduced activation of the knee extensor muscles (vastus medialis and lateralis) during the first double leg support and single leg support phases, and of the hip extensors (medial hamstrings) during the second double leg support of stair ascent, 2) overactivations of the hip extensors (gluteus maximus and medial hamstrings) during single leg support, and 3) longer cycle and step durations and lower cadences. Locomotor abnormalities in movements and muscle activations were generally found in patients with strength deficits greater than 25% while patients with smaller strength deficits (less than 25%) usually could climb stairs with normal performance. These results support the use of knee extensor strength measures to predict locomotor capacities, and also highlight the importance of postoperative knee strength rehabilitation."

The fatigue characteristics of the muscles were evaluated by having the subject perform 15 maximal contractions at 3.14 rad.s-1. Training was done on the same device (three times a week for 1-2 months), beginning either 2 or 6 weeks post-op. A repeated measures analysis of variance demonstrated a time effect but no differences between groups and no interactions. Torques developed by the knee flexors and extensors were significantly smaller 2 weeks post-op than pre-op, at all velocities tested. Torques developed in the quadriceps recovered to their pre-op values by 6 weeks, and further gained significantly in strength from 6 to 10 weeks. Quadriceps torques remained weaker than the contralateral side at 10 weeks. Hamstrings torques were either higher or similar to pre-op values by 6 weeks, and demonstrated increases from 6 to 10 weeks post-op at 1.05 and 4.19 rad.s-1 only.

The studies included patients with no previous injuries or operations.At short- and long-term follow-up, partial meniscectomy had a lower reoperation rate (1.4% [2 of 143] and 3.9% [52 of 1,319], respectively) than isolated meniscal repair (16.5% [47 of 284] and 20.7% [30 of 145], respectively). There was a slightly higher reoperation rate after partial lateral meniscectomy compared with partial medial meniscectomy. Repairs of the medial meniscus resulted in higher reoperation rates than repairs of the lateral meniscus. Meniscal repairs at the time of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction had a lower failure rate than isolated repairs. In the limited number of studies with long-term clinical outcome scores, meniscal repair was associated with higher Lysholm scores and less radiologic degeneration than partial meniscectomy.Whereas meniscal repairs have a higher reoperation rate than partial meniscectomies, they are associated with better long-term outcomes.Level IV, systematic review of Level I-IV studies.Copyright (c) 2011 Arthroscopy Association of North America.

Mixed-model repeated-measures analyses were used longitudinally to identify independent predictors of recovery, measured by prospectively assessing knee pain, knee function, and overall physical knee status preoperatively and at regular intervals throughout postoperative recovery.Neither advanced age nor increased body mass index had any influence on patient recovery over time, whereas gender was implicated, with women having significantly poorer recovery scores than men (P < .04). In addition, differences in variables indicating extent of meniscal tear and resection did not influence recovery scores over time, and the only surgical factor that impacted all 3 recovery variables was extent of osteoarthritis (P < .02).We have shown that female gender and worse osteoarthritis are associated with a slower rate of short-term recovery from arthroscopic partial meniscectomy whereas age, obesity, and amount of meniscal tear/resection showed no association with rate of recovery throughout the first year postoperatively.Level I, high-quality prognostic prospective study (all patients were enrolled at the same point in their disease with more than 80% follow-up of enrolled patients)."

However, in the last twenty years, there has been a significant decrease in the variability range. In order to estimate the water balance, in this work, an approach was developed to understand how water moves in time and space, and to determine possible inherent thresholds to lake variability. The historical Lake Patzcuaro height above 2035 masl was correlated with several climatic variables. The correlation with monthly rainfall shows that there is a delay of three months, indicating that the lake volume depends on three factors: precipitation, surface runoff and underground contribution, of which precipitation over the lake surface is the least significant. In the long term, using annual data, there is a remarkable memory of precipitation extending beyond five years, seen as a correlation with the accumulated precipitation anomaly (r2 = 0.76). This behavior should be explained by understanding relationship between the lake and its aquifer. Also important is the population growth, which affects the lake level in two ways: water extraction and water discharge. The models pointed out a nonlinear relationship between water level and the aforementioned variables, and suggest that the carrying capacity of the basin is around 90 thousand people, under current patterns of water consumption. It also indicates that, in order to allow lake recovery or to maintain system resilience, the anomaly of precipitation accumulated during several years should exceed 1000 mm.

O'Hara"", ""Sarah E. Metcalfe""]"	"There is a growing number of studies that use historical sources to reconstruct recent environmental change. In Mexico there are abundant sources of information that can be used to determine variations in the climate over the historical period. In this paper we draw together information from a variety of primary and secondary historical sources to reconstruct fluctuations in the climate of central Mexico over the last 600 years. The Aztecs are believed to have entered the Basin of Mexico during a period of severe drought. Wet conditions, however, characterized much of the Aztec (AD 1345-1521) and early colonial period prior to a return to drier conditions in the 1640s. Between 1640 and 1915, a series of severe droughts caused widespread devastation throughout central Mexico, particularly during the mid- to late 1700s and late 1800s. Since the early 1900s this region has experienced slightly wetter conditions. The climatic record from the Basin of Mexico is compared with proxy climatic data from two other areas in Mexico: a detailed lake-level curve from Lake Patzcuaro in central Mexico and the few tree-ring records from northern Mexico. Although the palaeoclimatic records from central Mexico are similar, there is greater divergence between the records from central and northern Mexico. In general, fluctuations in the climate over the last 600 years can be explained by changes in the relative strength of the summer 'monsoon', but it is possible that ENSO events can cause considerable differences in prevailing climate conditions in the northern and central parts of the country."

A time scale is based on ten AMS 14C dates and by tephra layers from Jorullo (AD 1759-1764) and Paricutin (AD 1943-1952) volcanoes. The multiproxy analyses presented in this study reveal abrupt changes in environmental and climatic conditions. The results are compared to the paleo-record from nearby Lake Patzcuaro. Dry conditions and low lake level are inferred in the late Pleistocene until ca. 15 cal kyr BP, followed by a slight but sustained increase in lake level, as well as a higher productivity, peaking at ca. 12.1 cal kyr BP. This interpretation is consistent with several regional climatic reconstructions in central Mexico, but it is in opposition to record from Lake Patzcuaro. A sediment hiatus bracketed between 12.1 and 7.2 cal kyr BP suggests a drop in lake level in response to a dry early Holocene. A deeper, more eutrophic and turbid lake is recorded after 7.2 cal kyr BP. Lake level at the coring site during the mid Holocene is considered the highest for the past 17 cal kyr BP. The emplacement of the La Magueyera lava flows (LMLF), dated by thermoluminiscence at 6560 +- 950 year, may have reduced basin volume and contributed to the relative deepening of the lake after 7.2 cal kyr BP. The late Holocene (after 3.9 cal kyr BP) climate is characterized by high instability. Extensive erosion, lower lake levels, dry conditions and pulses of high sediment influx due to high rainfall are inferred for this time. Further decrease in lake level and increased erosion are recorded after ca. AD 1050, at the peak of Purepechas occupation (AD 1300-1521), and until the eighteenth century. Few lacustrine records extend back to the late Pleistocene--early Holocene in central Mexico; this paper contributes to the understanding of late Pleistocene-Holocene paleoclimates in this region."

Pollen, diatom, and geochemical records from a 15 m core taken in 6 m of water continuously track vegetation and limnological changes in the P‡tzcuaro basin for the past 48 ky (calendar years). Pine, oak, and alder pollen dominate both the Wisconsin and Holocene vegetation record, and indicate that this region did not witness strongly arid climates during that time. Before the Holocene, Juniperus-type and Artemisia pollen document cooler climates of more effective moisture at least seasonally. Isoetes characterizes the full and late glacial interval (25Ð13 ka) and implies, along with the diatoms Aulacoseira and Stephanodiscus, cool, deep, freshwater conditions at Lago de P‡tzcuaro.The freshest and deepest lacustrine phase in the lake occurred 38 to 25 ka. During this time, Lago de P‡tzcuaro may have drained into the Lerma River system. Between 30 and 10 ka, diatom species that bloom in the winter and early spring imply moisture during those seasons. Evaluation of contemporaneous marine and terrestrial records west and east of Lago de P‡tzcuaro suggests that this moisture probably originated from westerly storm tracks shifted south by the Laurentide ice sheet.After 10 ka, Lago de P‡tzcuaro became shallower and more eutrophic. Rooted aquatic plants prospered under a climate regime of negative hydrologic budgets, increased seasonality, and moisture arriving during the summer as it does today. The lake became alkaline enough by the mid-Holocene to deposit ostracode-rich marls at the core site for the first time in the past 48 ky. Indigenous agriculture in the P‡tzcuaro drainage and around the lake appears about 4 ka, with the appearance of Zea and Chenopodiineae pollen.

A cleavage map was constructed for the mitochondrial DNA of each species. Comparison of the maps, aligned with respect to the origin and direction of DNA replication, revealed that the species differ from one another at most of the cleavage sites. The degree of divergence in nucleotide sequence at these sites was calculated from the fraction of cleavage sites shared by each pair of species. By plotting the degree of divergence in mitochondrial DNA against time of divergence, the rate of base substitution could be calculated from the initial slope of the curve. The value obtained, 0.02 substitutions per base pair per million years, was compared with the value for single-copy nuclear DNA. The rate of evolution of the mitochondrial genome appears to exceed that of the single-copy fraction of the nuclear genome by a factor of about 10. This high rate may be due, in part, to an elevated rate of mutation in mitochondrial DNA.

Rosenfeld"", ""Ansel Payne"", ""Rob DeSalle""]"	"Lineage sorting has been suggested as a major force in generating incongruent phylogenetic signal when multiple gene partitions are examined. The degree of lineage sorting can be estimated using the coalescent process and simulation studies have also pointed to a major role for incomplete lineage sorting as a factor in phylogenetic inference. Some recent empirical studies point to an extreme role for this phenomenon with up to 50-60% of all informative genes showing incongruence as a result of lineage sorting. Here, we examine seven large multi-partition genome level data sets over a large range of taxonomic representation. We took the approach of examining outgroup choice and its impact on tree topology, by swapping outgroups into analyses with successively larger genetics distances to the ingroup. Our results indicate a linear relationship of outgroup distance with incongruence in the data sets we examined suggesting a strong random rooting effect. In addition, we attempted to estimate the degree of lineage sorting in several large genome level data sets by examining triads of very closely related taxa. This exercise resulted in much lower estimates of incongruent genes that could be the result of lineage sorting, with an overall estimate of around 10% of the total number of genes in a genome showing incongruence as a result of true lineage sorting. Finally we examined the behavior of likelihood and parsimony approaches on the random rooting phenomenon. Likelihood tends to stabilize incongruence as outgroups get further and further away from the ingroup. In one extreme case, likelihood overcompensates for sequence divergence but increases random rooting causing long branch repulsion.Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

Degnan"", ""Luay Nakhleh""]"	"Analyses of the increasingly available genomic data continue to reveal the extent of hybridization and its role in the evolutionary diversification of various groups of species. We show, through extensive coalescent-based simulations of multilocus data sets on phylogenetic networks, how divergence times before and after hybridization events can result in incomplete lineage sorting with gene tree incongruence signatures identical to those exhibited by hybridization. Evolutionary analysis of such data under the assumption of a species tree model can miss all hybridization events, whereas analysis under the assumption of a species network model would grossly overestimate hybridization events. These issues necessitate a paradigm shift in evolutionary analysis under these scenarios, from a model that assumes a priori a single source of gene tree incongruence to one that integrates multiple sources in a unifying framework. We propose a framework of coalescence within the branches of a phylogenetic network and show how this framework can be used to detect hybridization despite incomplete lineage sorting. We apply the model to simulated data and show that the signature of hybridization can be revealed as long as the interval between the divergence times of the species involved in hybridization is not too small. We reanalyze a data set of 106 loci from 7 in-group Saccharomyces species for which a species tree with no hybridization has been reported in the literature. Our analysis supports the hypothesis that hybridization occurred during the evolution of this group, explaining a large amount of the incongruence in the data. Our findings show that an integrative approach to gene tree incongruence and its reconciliation is needed. Our framework will help in systematically analyzing genomic data for the occurrence of hybridization and elucidating its evolutionary role.

It has been suggested that Chirostoma, Poblana, and Menidia should be recognized as a single genus under the nominal Menidia. To test this hypothesis, phylogenetic relationships within the tribe Menidiini were assessed using the mitochondrially encoded ND2 gene. Monophyly of the Menidiini tribe was supported. Results also failed to support monophyly for the genera Menidia and Chirostoma as currently recognized. A central Mexican clade, inclusive of Chirostoma and Poblana, was recovered as monophyletic and strongly supported. Relationships within the Mesa Central clade support a previously recognized ""humboldtianum"" clade and the paraphyly of Chirostoma with respect to Poblana."

In this study, we tested whether the paleo-climatology and paleo-oceanography of the region could predict the genetic relationships among three Eastern Atlantic populations (Azores, Madeira, and Canaries) of a damselfish, Chromis limbata, and compared our results with its Mediterranean and adjacent Atlantic sister species, Chromis chromis. We combined phylogeographic and coalescent approaches using the fast evolving mitochondrial control region gene. No population structure was found for the three archipelagos. The coalescence time estimated for C. limbata (0.857-1.17 Mya) was much greater than that estimated for C. chromis. We propose that this difference reflects differences in glaciating extents in the Northeastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean. Diversity indexes (Hd and genetic distances) together with historical demographic parameters of C. limbata (Theta and g) revealed a more stable population history when compared to C. chromis. Our results suggest that the Macaronesian populations of C. limbata have probably been less affected by the last glaciation than the Mediterranean populations of C. chromis. Migration across the three archipelagos was estimated and a prevailing northwest trend was detected. This result supports the idea of a colonization of the Azores by warm water fish from Madeira or the westernmost Canary islands which acted as major glacial refugia for the tropical and subtropical marine fauna during the glaciations."

Wagner"", ""Jonathan D. Johnston"", ""Iain J. Clarke"", ""Gerald A. Lincoln"", ""David G. Hazlerigg""]"	"At temperate latitudes, increases in day length in the spring promote the summer phenotype. In mammals, this long-day response is mediated by decreasing nightly duration of melatonin secretion by the pineal gland. This affects adenylate cyclase signal transduction and clock gene expression in melatonin-responsive cells in the pars tuberalis of the pituitary, which control seasonal prolactin secretion. To define the photoperiodic limits of the mammalian long day response, we transferred short day (8 h light per 24 h) acclimated Soay sheep to various longer photoperiods, simulating those occurring from spring to summer in their northerly habitat (57 degrees N). Locomotor activity and plasma melatonin rhythms remained synchronized to the light-dark cycle in all photoperiods. Surprisingly, transfer to 16-h light/day had a greater effect on prolactin secretion and oestrus activity than shorter (12 h) or longer (20 and 22 h) photoperiods. The 16-h photoperiod also had the largest effect on expression of circadian (per1) and neuroendocrine output (betaTSH) genes in the pars tuberalis and on kisspeptin gene expression in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, which modulates reproductive activity. This critical photoperiodic window of responsiveness to long days in mammals is predicted by a model wherein adenylate cyclase sensitization and clock gene phasing effects of melatonin combine to control neuroendocrine output. This adaptive mechanism may be related to the latitude of origin and the timing of the seasonal transitions."

To understand the mechanisms by which the melatonin signal is decoded, we studied the photoperiodic control of prolactin secretion in Soay sheep, which is mediated via melatonin responsive cells in the pars tuberalis of the pituitary. We demonstrate that the phases of peak expression of the clock genes Cryptochrome1 (Cry1), Period1 (Per1), and RevErbalpha respond acutely to altered melatonin secretion after a switch from short to long days. Cry1 is activated by melatonin onset, forming the dusk component of the molecular decoder, while Per1 expression at dawn reflects the offset of melatonin secretion. The Cry1-Per1 interval immediately adjusts to the melatonin signal on the first long day, and this is followed within 24 hr by an increase in prolactin secretion. The timing of peak RevErbalpha expression also responds to a switch to long days due to altered melatonin secretion but does not immediately reset to an entrained long-day state.

During circadian negative feedback, RNA polymerase II accumulated near termination sites on Per and Cry genes but not on control genes.

NR, but not SR, are gregarious which enabled us to examine the integrated effects of differences in social organisation and the photic environment at two different latitudes on the organisation of activity. In both sub-species, ultradian bouts of activity and inactivity alternated across the 24-h day throughout the year. This pattern was modified by the LD cycle in NR but barely at all in SR. Periodogram analysis revealed significant ultradian rhythmicity in both sub-species; the frequency of daily cycles of activity increased from three per day in winter to nearly five in summer. We conclude that this increase, and a concomitant increase in the level of daily activity, reflected the seasonal increase in the animals' appetite and the quality of their forage. Secondly, the combination, most evident in SR, of a weak photic response, weak circadian mechanisms and a weak social synchronization reduces the constraints of biological timing in an environment which is effectively non-rhythmic most of the year and permits expression of the basic ultradian pattern of ruminant activity.

Increased inflammation is one of the common underlying mechanisms of these diseases, thus raising a hypothesis that circadian-oscillator components may regulate immune response. Here we show that absence of the core clock component protein cryptochrome (CRY) leads to constitutive elevation of proinflammatory cytokines in a cell-autonomous manner. We observed a constitutive NF-kB and protein kinase A (PKA) signaling activation in Cry1(-/-);Cry2(-/-) cells. We further demonstrate that increased phosphorylation of p65 at S276 residue in Cry1(-/-);Cry2(-/-) cells is due to increased PKA signaling activity, likely induced by a significantly high basal level of cAMP, which we detected in these cells. In addition, we report that CRY1 binds to adenylyl cyclase and limits cAMP production. Based on these data, we propose that absence of CRY protein(s) might release its (their) inhibition on cAMP production, resulting in elevated cAMP and increased PKA activation, subsequently leading to NF-kB activation through phosphorylation of p65 at S276.

Elevations in circulating glucagon and epinephrine, two hormones that activate hepatic gluconeogenesis, trigger the cAMP-mediated phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein (Creb) and dephosphorylation of the Creb-regulated transcription coactivator-2 (Crtc2)--two key transcriptional regulators of this process. Although the underlying mechanism is unclear, hepatic gluconeogenesis is also regulated by the circadian clock, which coordinates glucose metabolism with changes in the external environment. Circadian control of gene expression is achieved by two transcriptional activators, Clock and Bmal1, which stimulate cryptochrome (Cry1 and Cry2) and Period (Per1, Per2 and Per3) repressors that feed back on Clock-Bmal1 activity. Here we show that Creb activity during fasting is modulated by Cry1 and Cry2, which are rhythmically expressed in the liver. Cry1 expression was elevated during the night-day transition, when it reduced fasting gluconeogenic gene expression by blocking glucagon-mediated increases in intracellular cAMP concentrations and in the protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of Creb. In biochemical reconstitution studies, we found that Cry1 inhibited accumulation of cAMP in response to G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) activation but not to forskolin, a direct activator of adenyl cyclase. Cry proteins seemed to modulate GPCR activity directly through interaction with G(s)a.

Main outcome: The main outcome was signature BAT gene transcripts and protein in biopsies of supraclavicular fat with sc fat as negative control. Results: PET-CT was positive in three and negative in 14 patients. PET-positive fat harbored multilobulated lipid droplets and stained strongly for uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1).

We sought to determine whether SD-dependent changes in circadian clock gene expression parallel this strain difference described previously at the EEG level. The effects of enforced wakefulness of incremental durations of up to 6 h on the expression of circadian clock genes (bmal1, clock, cry1, cry2, csnk1epsilon, npas2, per1, and per2) were assessed in AKR/J, C57BL/6J, and DBA/2J mice, three strains that exhibit distinct EEG responses to SD. Cortical expression of clock genes subsequent to SD was proportional to the increase in delta power that occurs in inbred strains: the strain that exhibits the most robust EEG response to SD (AKR/J) exhibited dramatic increases in expression of bmal1, clock, cry2, csnkIepsilon, and npas2, whereas the strain with the least robust response to SD (DBA/2) exhibited either no change or a decrease in expression of these genes and cry1. The effect of SD on circadian clock gene expression was maintained in mice in which both of the cryptochrome genes were genetically inactivated. cry1 and cry2 appear to be redundant in sleep regulation as elimination of either of these genes did not result in a significant deficit in sleep homeostasis.

Peripheral oscillators are self-sustained and cell autonomous, but they have to be synchronized by the SCN to ensure phase coherence within the organism. In principle, the rhythmic expression of genes in peripheral organs could thus be driven not only by local oscillators, but also by circadian systemic signals. To discriminate between these mechanisms, we engineered a mouse strain with a conditionally active liver clock, in which REV-ERBa represses the transcription of the essential core clock gene Bmal1 in a doxycycline-dependent manner. We examined circadian liver gene expression genome-wide in mice in which hepatocyte oscillators were either running or arrested, and found that the rhythmic transcription of most genes depended on functional hepatocyte clocks. However, we discovered 31 genes, including the core clock gene mPer2, whose expression oscillated robustly irrespective of whether the liver clock was running or not. By contrast, in liver explants cultured in vitro, circadian cycles of mPer2::luciferase bioluminescence could only be observed when hepatocyte oscillators were operational. Hence, the circadian cycles observed in the liver of intact animals without functional hepatocyte oscillators were likely generated by systemic signals. The finding that rhythmic mPer2 expression can be driven by both systemic cues and local oscillators suggests a plausible mechanism for the phase entrainment of subsidiary clocks in peripheral organs"	"However, there are gaps of knowledge, as the impact of melatonin on transcription of CRY1 (Hazlerigg et al., 2004;MacGregor and Lincoln, 2008), the roles of PER2 and CRY1 as a systematically driven genes that bear a signal of time in a correct phase throughout the tissues (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2007;Hughes et al., 2012), and the cryptochrome-independent influence of the PER2 protein on transcription of the ARNTL (BMAL1) gene (Schmutz et al., 2010;Ye et al., 2011) are not yet understood in depth."

Ko"", ""Joseph S. Takahashi""]"	"Mammals synchronize their circadian activity primarily to the cycles of light and darkness in the environment. This is achieved by ocular photoreception relaying signals to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the hypothalamus. Signals from the SCN cause the synchronization of independent circadian clocks throughout the body to appropriate phases. Signals that can entrain these peripheral clocks include humoral signals, metabolic factors, and body temperature. At the level of individual tissues, thousands of genes are brought to unique phases through the actions of a local transcription/translation-based feedback oscillator and systemic cues. In this molecular clock, the proteins CLOCK and BMAL1 cause the transcription of genes which ultimately feedback and inhibit CLOCK and BMAL1 transcriptional activity. Finally, there are also other molecular circadian oscillators which can act independently of the transcription-based clock in all species which have been tested."

Our studies investigate the importance of the SCN in regulating ultradian rhythmicity. Two approaches were used to dissociate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis from normal circadian input in rats: (i) exposure to a constant light (LL) environment and (ii) electrolytic lesioning of the SCN. Blood was sampled using an automated sampling system. As expected, both treatments resulted in a loss of the circadian pattern of corticosterone secretion. Ultradian pulsatile secretion of corticosterone however, was maintained across the 24 h in all animals. Furthermore, the loss of SCN input revealed an underlying relationship between locomotor and HPA activity. In control (LD) rats there was no clear correlation between ultradian locomotor activity and hormone secretion, whereas, in LL rats, episodes of ultradian activity were consistently followed by periods of increased pulsatile hormone secretion. These data clearly demonstrate that the ultradian rhythm of corticosterone secretion is generated through a mechanism independent of the SCN input, supporting recent evidence for a sub-hypothalamic pulse generator.(c) 2012 The Authors.

Our aim was to characterize vulnerable groups for excess mortality among people with SMI, substance use disorders, depressive episode, and recurrent depressive disorder.A case register was developed at the South London and Maudsley National Health Services Foundation Trust (NHS SLAM), accessing full electronic clinical records on over 150,000 mental health service users as a well-defined cohort since 2006. The Case Register Interactive Search (CRIS) system enabled searching and retrieval of anonymised information since 2008. Deaths were identified by regular national tracing returns after 2006. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated for the period 2007 to 2009 using SLAM records for this period and the expected number of deaths from age-specific mortality statistics for the England and Wales population in 2008. Data were stratified by gender, ethnicity, and specific mental disorders.A total of 31,719 cases, aged 15 years old or more, active between 2007-2009 and with mental disorders of interest prior to 2009 were detected in the SLAM case register. SMRs were 2.15 (95% CI: 1.95-2.36) for all SMI with genders combined, 1.89 (1.64-2.17) for women and 2.47 (2.17-2.80) for men. In addition, highest mortality risk was found for substance use disorders (SMR = 4.17; 95% CI: 3.75-4.64). Age- and gender-standardised mortality ratios by ethnic group revealed huge fluctuations, and SMRs for all disorders diminished in strength with age. The main limitation was the setting of secondary mental health care provider in SLAM.Substantially higher mortality persists in people with serious mental illness, substance use disorders and depressive disorders.

Galdas"", ""Francine Cheater"", ""Paul Marshall""]"	"Aim: This paper reviews the key research literature regarding men's health-related help seeking behaviour. Background: There is a growing body of research in the United States to suggest that men are less likely than women to seek help from health professionals for problems as diverse as depression, substance abuse, physical disabilities and stressful life events. Previous research has revealed that the principle health related issue facing men in the UK is their reluctance to seek access to health services. Method: The investigation of men's health-related help seeking behaviour has great potential for improving both men and women's lives and reducing national health costs through the development of responsive and effective interventions. A search of the literature was conducted using CINAHL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO and the Cochrane Library databases. Results: Studies comparing men and women are inadequate in explaining the processes involved in men's help seeking behaviour. However, the growing body of gender-specific studies highlights a trend of delayed help seeking when they become ill. A prominent theme among white middle class men implicates ""traditional masculine behaviour"" as an explanation for delays in seeking help among men who experience illness. The reasons and processes behind this issue, however, have received limited attention. Conclusions: Principally, the role of masculine beliefs and the similarities and differences between men of differing background requires further attention, particularly given the health inequalities that exist between men of differing socio-economic status and ethnicity. Further research using heterogeneous samples is required in order to gain a greater understanding of the triggers and barriers associated with the decision making process of help seeking behaviour in men who experience illness."

METHOD The authors reviewed 40 studies for which there was information available on rates of health care contact and examined age and gender differences among the subjects.   RESULTS Contact with primary care providers in the time leading up to suicide is common. While three of four suicide victims had contact with primary care providers within the year of suicide, approximately one-third of the suicide victims had contact with mental health services. About one in five suicide victims had contact with mental health services within a month before their suicide. On average, 45% of suicide victims had contact with primary care providers within 1 month of suicide. Older adults had higher rates of contact with primary care providers within 1 month of suicide than younger adults.   CONCLUSIONS While it is not known to what degree contact with mental health care and primary care providers can prevent suicide, the majority of individuals who die by suicide do make contact with primary care providers, particularly older adults. Given that this pattern is consistent with overall health-service-seeking, alternate approaches to suicide-prevention efforts may be needed for those less likely to be seen in primary care or mental health specialty care, specifically young men."

OBJECTIVE: To estimate 12-month prevalence, severity, and comorbidity of DSM-IV anxiety, mood, impulse control, and substance disorders in the recently completed US National Comorbidity Survey Replication. DESIGN AND SETTING: Nationally representative face-to-face household survey conducted between February 2001 and April 2003 using a fully structured diagnostic interview, the World Health Organization World Mental Health Survey Initiative version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. PARTICIPANTS: Nine thousand two hundred eighty-two English-speaking respondents 18 years and older. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Twelve-month DSM-IV disorders. RESULTS: Twelve-month prevalence estimates were anxiety, 18.1%; mood, 9.5%; impulse control, 8.9%; substance, 3.8%; and any disorder, 26.2%. Of 12-month cases, 22.3% were classified as serious; 37.3%, moderate; and 40.4%, mild. Fifty-five percent carried only a single diagnosis; 22%, 2 diagnoses; and 23%, 3 or more diagnoses.

Psychiatric disorders were identified with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), and information on sociodemographic characteristics and criminal history was gathered using a semi-structured interview.Psychiatric disorders were present in all cases and 62% of controls. Most current psychiatric disorders were associated with near-lethal suicide attempts, including major depression (odds ratio (OR) = 42.0, 95% CI 5.8-305), psychosis (OR = 15.0, 95% CI 2.0-113), anxiety disorders (OR = 6.0, 95% CI 2.3-15.5) and drug misuse (OR = 2.9, 95% CI 1.3-6.4). Lifetime psychiatric disorders associated with near-lethal attempts included recurrent depression and psychoses. Although cases were more likely than controls to meet criteria for antisocial personality disorder, the difference was not statistically significant.

A total of 4,501 adults were recruited from two general practices during a population-based survey conducted at the start of 1992. At baseline psychological distress was assessed using the General Health Questionnaire (12-item version, GHQ-12). The relationship between levels of distress and subsequent mortality was examined using Cox proportional hazard models.Risk of all-cause mortality was greatest in subjects reporting the highest levels of distress (hazard ratio (HR) 1.71, 95% CI 1.32-2.23) but was also raised in subjects reporting intermediate distress (HR 1.38 95% CI 1.06-1.79) when compared to those reporting no distress. Increased risk of mortality in subjects reporting distress appeared to be due largely to an excess of deaths from ischaemic heart disease (high distress, HR 1.90, 95% CI 1.08-3.35; intermediate distress, HR 1.58, 95% CI 0.90-2.76) and respiratory diseases (high distress, HR 5.39, 95% CI 2.70-10.78; intermediate distress, HR 2.33, 95% CI 1.12-4.22).The association between mortality and psychological distress observed in this study seems to arise largely because of premature deaths from ischaemic heart disease and respiratory diseases.

The WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) was used to assess lifetime DSM-IV anxiety, mood, and substance use disorders. Ages of onset for individual disorders and ages of first treatment contact for each disorder were used to calculate the extent of failure and delay in initial help seeking. The proportion of lifetime cases making treatment contact in the year of disorder onset ranged from 0.8 to 36.4% for anxiety disorders, from 6.0 to 52.1% for mood disorders, and from 0.9 to 18.6% for substance use disorders. By 50 years, the proportion of lifetime cases making treatment contact ranged from 15.2 to 95.0% for anxiety disorders, from 7.9 to 98.6% for mood disorders, and from 19.8 to 86.1% for substance use disorders. Median delays among cases eventually making contact ranged from 3.0 to 30.0 years for anxiety disorders, from 1.0 to 14.0 years for mood disorders, and from 6.0 to 18.0 years for substance use disorders. Failure and delays in treatment seeking were generally greater in developing countries, older cohorts, men, and cases with earlier ages of onset.

Participants without a current or lifetime diagnosis of MDD at baseline (n = 2,752) were followed for 1 year. MDD was assessed using the World Health Organization's Composite International Diagnostic Interview-Auto 2.1. The overall 1-year incidence of MDD was 3.6% (95% confidence interval: 2.8, 4.6); it was 2.9% (95% confidence interval: 1.9, 4.2) in men and 4.5% (95% confidence interval: 3.3, 6.2) in women. The relations between work environmental factors and MDD differed by sex. In men, high job strain increased the risk of MDD in those who worked 35-40 hours per week; job insecurity and family-to-work conflict were predictive of MDD. Women who worked 35-40 hours per week and reported job insecurity, a high effort-reward imbalance, and work-to-family conflict were at a higher risk of developing MDD. Job strain, effort-reward imbalance, job insecurity, and work-to-family conflicts are important risk factors for the onset of MDD and should be targets of primary prevention.

In estimating the effect of baseline employment status on suicide, adjustments were made for baseline demographic and socio-economic variables.After 3 years of follow-up, unemployed men were a little over twice as likely to commit suicide as their employed counterparts. Among men, the lower the socio-economic status, the higher the suicide risk. Among women, in each year of follow-up, the unemployed had a much higher suicide risk than the employed. After 9 years of follow-up unemployed women were over three times more likely to kill themselves than their employed counterparts.Unemployment is strongly related to suicide, but this relationship is more enduring and stronger among women. For men, the unemployment effect is stronger at earlier years of follow-up. In women, unemployment increases the risk of suicide regardless of the number of follow-up years.

Suicides inject an atmosphere of unrest into society, and media attention furthers that social uneasiness. From the viewpoint of economics and management, suicide is a waste of human resource: it decreases the labor force in society and deteriorates human capital. This paper provides a series of analyses of suicide rate based on theoretical reasoning and empirical approaches. Aggregate data from G7 countries are obtained and stacked into panel data for analysis. Data are collected for different age groups. Even though suicide issues have been extensively discussed in the past, newly developed econometric tools are applied to her. Beyond previously recognized relationships between economic factors and suicide rates findings include that unemployment strikes men more than women in terms of psychological pressure: for middle age or older women, unemployment may even be positive for the entire family; and female labor force participation exerts pressure on male counterparts and increases its suicide rate. As a result, a low income family with an unemployed man and an employed woman is at high risk for adult male suicide."

RECENT FINDINGS: Median and inter-quartile range (IQR; 25th-75th percentiles) of age-of-onset is much earlier for phobias (7-14, IQR 4-20) and impulse-control disorders (7-15; IQR 4-35) than other anxiety disorders (25-53, IQR 15-75), mood disorders (25-45, IQR 17-65), and substance disorders (18-29, IQR 16-43). Although less data exist for nonaffective psychosis, available evidence suggests that median age-of-onset is in the range late teens through early 20s. Roughly half of all lifetime mental disorders in most studies start by the mid-teens and three quarters by the mid-20s. Later onsets are mostly secondary conditions. Severe disorders are typically preceded by less severe disorders that are seldom brought to clinical attention. SUMMARY: First onset of mental disorders usually occur in childhood or adolescence, although treatment typically does not occur until a number of years later. Although interventions with early incipient disorders might help reduce severity-persistence of primary disorders and prevent secondary disorders, additional research is needed on appropriate treatments for early incipient cases and on long-term evaluation of the effects of early intervention on secondary prevention.The core activities of the WMH are supported by the National Institute of Mental Health (R01 MH070884), the John D. and Catherine T.

Furthermore, it has been hypothesized that mortality rates in depressed men are higher than in depressed women. Finally, it is not clear if the increased mortality rates exist only in major depression or also in subclinical depression.   METHODS A meta-analysis was conducted to examine these questions. A total of 25 studies with 106,628 subjects, of whom 6416 were depressed, were examined. Both univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted.   RESULTS The overall relative risk (RR) of dying in depressed subjects was 1.81 (95% CI: 1.58-2.07) compared to non-depressed subjects. No major differences were found between men and women, although the RR was somewhat larger in men. The RR in subclinical depression was no smaller than the RR in clinical depression.   LIMITATIONS Only RRs of mortality were examined, which were not corrected for important confounding variables, such as chronic illnesses, or life-style. In the selected studies important differences existed between study characteristics and populations. The number of comparisons was relatively small.   CONCLUSIONS There is an increased risk of mortality in depression. An important finding of this study is that the increased risk not only exists in major depression, but also in subclinical forms of depression.

Kaner"", ""Heather O Dickinson"", ""Fiona R Beyer"", ""Fiona Campbell"", ""Carla Schlesinger"", ""Nick Heather"", ""John B Saunders"", ""Bernard Burnand"", ""Elizabeth D Pienaar""]"	"Background: Excessive drinking is a significant cause of mortality, morbidity and social problems in many countries. Brief interventions aim to reduce alcohol consumption and related harm in hazardous and harmful drinkers who are not actively seeking help for alcohol problems. Interventions usually take the form of a conversation with a primary care provider and may include feedback on the person's alcohol use, information about potential harms and benefits of reducing intake, and advice on how to reduce consumption. Discussion informs the development of a personal plan to help reduce consumption. Brief interventions can also include behaviour change or motivationally-focused counselling.This is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 2007. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of screening and brief alcohol intervention to reduce excessive alcohol consumption in hazardous or harmful drinkers in general practice or emergency care settings. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and 12 other bibliographic databases to September 2017. We searched Alcohol and Alcohol Problems Science Database (to December 2003, after which the database was discontinued), trials registries, and websites. We carried out handsearching and checked reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of brief interventions to reduce hazardous or harmful alcohol consumption in people attending general practice, emergency care or other primary care settings for reasons other than alcohol treatment. The comparison group was no or minimal intervention, where a measure of alcohol consumption was reported. 'Brief intervention' was defined as a conversation comprising five or fewer sessions of brief advice or brief lifestyle counselling and a total duration of less than 60 minutes. Any more was considered an extended intervention. Digital interventions were not included in this review. Data collection and analysis: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We carried out subgroup analyses where possible to investigate the impact of factors such as gender, age, setting (general practice versus emergency care), treatment exposure and baseline consumption. Main results: We included 69 studies that randomised a total of 33,642 participants. Of these, 42 studies were added for this update (24,057 participants). Most interventions were delivered in general practice (38 studies, 55%) or emergency care (27 studies, 39%) settings. Most studies (61 studies, 88%) compared brief intervention to minimal or no intervention. Extended interventions were compared with brief (4 studies, 6%), minimal or no intervention (7 studies, 10%). Few studies targeted particular age groups: adolescents or young adults (6 studies, 9%) and older adults (4 studies, 6%). Mean baseline alcohol consumption was 244 g/week (30.5 standard UK units) among the studies that reported these data. Main sources of bias were attrition and lack of provider or participant blinding. The primary meta-analysis included 34 studies (15,197 participants) and provided moderate-quality evidence that participants who received brief intervention consumed less alcohol than minimal or no intervention participants after one year (mean difference (MD) -20 g/week, 95% confidence interval (CI) -28 to -12). There was substantial heterogeneity among studies (I_ = 73%). A subgroup analysis by gender demonstrated that both men and women reduced alcohol consumption after receiving a brief intervention.We found moderate-quality evidence that brief alcohol interventions have little impact on frequency of binges per week (MD -0.08, 95% CI -0.14 to -0.02; 15 studies, 6946 participants); drinking days per week (MD -0.13, 95% CI -0.23 to -0.04; 11 studies, 5469 participants); or drinking intensity (-0.2 g/drinking day, 95% CI -3.1 to 2.7; 10 studies, 3128 participants).We found moderate-quality evidence of little difference in quantity of alcohol consumed when extended and no or minimal interventions were compared (-14 g/week, 95% CI -37 to 9; 6 studies, 1296 participants). There was little difference in binges per week (-0.08, 95% CI -0.28 to 0.12; 2 studies, 456 participants; moderate-quality evidence) or difference in days drinking per week (-0.45, 95% CI -0.81 to -0.09; 2 studies, 319 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Extended versus no or minimal intervention provided little impact on drinking intensity (9 g/drinking day, 95% CI -26 to 9; 1 study, 158 participants; low-quality evidence).Extended intervention had no greater impact than brief intervention on alcohol consumption, although findings were imprecise (MD 2 g/week, 95% CI -42 to 45; 3 studies, 552 participants; low-quality evidence). Numbers of binges were not reported for this comparison, but one trial suggested a possible drop in days drinking per week (-0.5, 95% CI -1.2 to 0.2; 147 participants; low-quality evidence). Results from this trial also suggested very little impact on drinking intensity (-1.7 g/drinking day, 95% CI -18.9 to 15.5; 147 participants; very low-quality evidence).Only five studies reported adverse effects (very low-quality evidence). No participants experienced any adverse effects in two studies; one study reported that the intervention increased binge drinking for women and two studies reported adverse events related to driving outcomes but concluded they were equivalent in both study arms.Sources of funding were reported by 67 studies (87%). With two exceptions, studies were funded by government institutes, research bodies or charitable foundations. One study was partly funded by a pharmaceutical company and a brewers association, another by a company developing diagnostic testing equipment. Authors' conclusions: We found moderate-quality evidence that brief interventions can reduce alcohol consumption in hazardous and harmful drinkers compared to minimal or no intervention. Longer counselling duration probably has little additional effect. Future studies should focus on identifying the components of interventions which are most closely associated with effectiveness."

Twenty percent of individuals and 15% of species were classified as specialists in such habitats, and 26% and 24%, respectively, as more widely distributed 'grassland species'. Management effects were analyzed as part of stepwise multiple linear regressions for each of 15 specialist and 12 grassland species. Most specialists showed significantly increased numbers associated with less frequent and/or less intrusive managements. However, leaving habitat entirely unmanaged was rarely optimal. Single occasional wildfires were typically more favorable for specialist abundance than regular rotational burning, which often produced very low numbers. Mechanical cutting appeared more favorable than grazing. No management type was clearly favorable for all specialists of a given habitat. The grassland species tended to respond similarly to the specialists except that several favored more frequent and/or more intrusive management and that mechanical cutting was not markedly better for their abundance than grazing, nor wildfire than rotational burning. For conserving specialist butterflies, both consistency of management type within site and deliberate differences in management type among sites of like habitat is desirable."

The species composition and abundance of Lepidoptera (light traps) and Coleoptera (pitfall traps) were monitored for 4 years (1994-1997) simultaneously on two sites - in the edaphic climax pine forest and in wetland successional habitats. The method of statistical evaluation by RDA and CCA ordination, representing the habitat preference of species of Coleoptera (Carabidae only) and Lepidoptera (all nocturnal phototactic taxa) between the edaphic climax forest and succession stages, was used. All categories of the peatland taxa (tyrphobiontic, tyrphophilous and tyrphoneutral species) were analysed. Ten highly stenotopic tyrphobiontic species and 23 tyrphophilous species of Lepidoptera (out of 487) were most characteristic of the bog habitat. Only two tyrphophilous carabid species (out of 20) were characteristic of the bog. The most important relict species (tyrphobionts) of Lepidoptera are most diverse and abundant within the successional habitats and in the open wet forest. The relict fauna of the closed climax pine forest is much less diverse and composed mostly of abundant tyrphophilous and tyrphoneutral forest species. Preservation or restoration of sufficiently constant hydrological conditions, which prevents formation of the closed forest, is the basic management for habitat conservation of all relict tyrphobiontic species of the Cervene Blato bog and similar peat land habitat islands. The peat bog is a unified complex system of specific diverse and relict taxa. The most specific taxa are tyrphobiontic Lepidoptera, but a number of other vulnerable tyrphophilous and tyrphoneutral insects are associated with the peat bog as well."

CCT306	81075756	The butterfly fauna of Wisconsin bogs: lessons for conservation	Ann Swengel	Effectiveness of a Vegetation-Based Approach to Insect Conservation	"[""Ron Panzer"", ""Mark W. Schwartz""]"	"We used plant and insect data from 50 prairie reserves in the Chicago region to assess the extent to which reliance on plant criteria for conservation planning might result in the conservation of insect biodiversity within the tallgrass prairie ecosystem. Three of nine plant measures--plant community richness, plant species richness, and plant genus richness--were found to explain significant levels of variation in conservative (reserve-requiring) insect species richness in best-fit regressions. Native plant species richness explained from 28% to 49% (80-85%, on average, when coupled with area) of the variance in conservative insect species richness among sites, suggesting that plants are a useful indicator taxon. Conservative insect species were well represented within the botanically selected Chicago-area reserve system, providing additional support for the vegetation-based ""coarse-filter"" preserve selection approach. We found no evidence of concurrence between either conservative plant species richness or rare plant richness and conservative insect species richness, suggesting that the use of additional ""fine-filter"" plant data may not increase capture rates for reserve-requiring insects. Among nine plant measures, only plant community richness showed (limited) promise as a surrogate for rare insect richness. We found no coincidence between either plant species richness or common insect species richness and rare insect species richness, supporting earlier suggestions that a ""hot spot"" approach might fail to capture rare species at finer spatial scales. Low levels of coincidence between plant family richness and insect species richness suggest that the use of higher taxa for cost-effective reserve selection may not be an effective conservation strategy. We conclude that a vegetation-based coarse-filter approach, emphasizing native plant species and plant community richness, can contribute substantially to the conservation of insect biodiversity in tallgrass prairie regions, and perhaps within temperate regions generally. We caution, however, that effective protection of rare insect species will require a detailed knowledge of their identity and distribution within the region under consideration.        Efectividad de un Enfoque de Conservacion de Insectos Basado en Vegetacion        Utilizamos datos de plantas e insectos de 50 reservas de pradera en la region de Chicago para evaluar el grado en que la planeacion de conservacion basada en plantas se refleje en la conservacion de la biodiversidad de insectos en el ecosistema de praderas de pastizales altos. Por medio del mejor ajuste de la regresion encontramos que tres de nueve medidas de plantas (riqueze de comunidades de plantas, riqueza de especies de platas y riqueza de generos de plantas) explican los niveles significativos de variacion en la riqueza de especies de insectos conservadores (que requieren de reservas). La riqueza de especies de plantas nativas explico del 28% al 49% (80-85%, en promedio, cuando acoplada con el area) de la variacion en la riqueza de especies de insectos conservadoras entre sitios, lo cual sugiere que las plantas son un taxon indicator util. Las especies de insectos conservadores estaban bien representadas en el sistema de reservas en el area de Chicago seleccionadas botanicamente, lo cual proporciono un argumento adicional para el enfoque de seleccion de reservas de ""filtro grueso"" basado en la vegetacion. No encontramos evidencia de concurrencia entre la riqueza de especies de plantas conservadoras o la riqueza de plantas raras con la riqueza de especies de insectos conservadores, lo cual sugiere que el uso de datos de ""filtro fino"" de plantas no incrementa las tasas de captura de insectos que requieren reservas. Entre las nueve medidas de plantas, solo la riqueza de comunidades mostro indicio (limitado) como sustituto de la riqueza de especies de insectos raros. No encontramos coincidencia entre la riqueza de especies de plantas o la riqueza de especies de insectos comunes y la riqueza de especies de insectos raros, lo cual soporta la idea de que el enfoque de ""zona algida"" puede no capturar a especies raras en escalas espaciales finas. Los bajos niveles de coincidencia entre la riqueza de familias de plantas y la riqueza de especies de insectos sugiere que el uso de taxa mayores para la seleccion de reservas efectivas no es una estrategia efectiva de conservacion. Concluimos que el enfoque de ""filtro grueso"" basado en la vegetacion, que enfatiza la riqueza de especies de plantas nativas y de comunidades de plantas, puede contribuir substancialmente a la conservacion de la biodiversidad de insectos en praderas con pastos altos y, quizas, en general para regiones templadas.

Aquaplanet, fixed sea surface temperature lower boundary conditions are used in both models to study the response of the Hadley cell width to changes in both global mean temperature and pole-to-equator temperature gradient. The primary sensitivity of both models is a large expansion of the Hadley cell with increased mean temperature. The models also exhibit a smaller increase in width with temperature gradient. The Hadley cell widths agree well with a scaling theory by Held which assumes that the width is determined by the latitude where baroclinic eddies begin to occur. As surface temperatures are warmed, the latitude of baroclinic instability onset is shifted poleward due to increases in the static stability of the subtropics, which is increased in an atmosphere with higher moisture content."

Through the release of latent heat when it condenses, it also plays an active role in dynamic processes that shape the global circulation of the atmosphere and thus climate. Here we present an overview of how latent heat release affects atmosphere dynamics in a broad range of climates, ranging from extremely cold to extremely warm. Contrary to widely held beliefs, atmospheric circulation statistics can change non-monotonically with global-mean surface temperature, in part because of dynamic effects of water vapor. For example, the strengths of the tropical Hadley circulation and of zonally asymmetric tropical circulations, as well as the kinetic energy of extratropical baroclinic eddies, can be lower than they presently are both in much warmer climates and in much colder climates. We discuss how latent heat release is implicated in such circulation changes, particularly through its effect on the atmospheric static stability, and we illustrate the circulation changes through simulations with an idealized general circulation model. This allows us to explore a continuum of climates, constrain macroscopic laws governing this climatic continuum, and place past and possible future climate changes in a broader context.Comment: 22 pages, 11 figure"	"In addition, we try to assess whether the response is consistent with or explainable by simple physical arguments, some of which have been presented in the literature before (see also the review by #AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2010)."

A prior study using the NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) AM2.1 atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) demonstrated that uniform SST warming strengthens the prevailing northerly advection of dry Saharan air into the Sahel. The present study uses uniform SST warming simulations performed with 7 GFDL and 10 CMIP5 AGCMs to assess the robustness of this drying mechanism across models and uses observations to assess the physical credibility of the severe drying response in AM2.1. In all 17 AGCMs, mean SST warming enhances the free-tropospheric meridional moisture gradient spanning the Sahel and with it the Saharan dry-air advection. Energetically, this is partially balanced by anomalous subsidence, yielding decreased precipitation in 14 of the 17 models. Anomalous subsidence and precipitation are tightly linked across the GFDL models but not the CMIP5 models, precluding the use of this relationship as the start of a causal chain ending in an emergent observational constraint. For AM2.1, cloud-rainfall covariances generate radiative feedbacks on drying through the subsidence mechanism and through surface hydrology that are excessive compared to observations at the interannual time scale. These feedbacks also act in the equilibrium response to uniform warming, calling into question the Sahel's severe drying response to warming in all coupled models using AM2.1"	"A number of studies have found and/or argued that the strength of aspects of the tropical circulation will weaken with global warming (Knutson and Manabe, 1995;#AUTHOR_TAG and Soden, 2006;Vecchi and Soden, 2007;Kang et al., 2013), although there is some evidence from reanalyses that the boreal winter Hadley Cell has actually strengthened in recent decades (Mitas and Clement, 2005)."

This shift in the circulation alters climate change in regional winter rainfall by an amount large enough to significantly alter regional climate change projections. The changes are consistent with changes in stratospheric winds inducing a change in the baroclinic eddy growth rate across the depth of the troposphere. A change in mean wind structure and an equatorward shift of the tropospheric storm tracks relative to models with poor stratospheric resolution allows coupling with surface climate.

One approach to quantifying carbon biomass stores consists in inferring changes from long-term forest inventory plots.

We provide a critical reassessment of the quality and the robustness of these models across tropical forest types, using a large dataset of 2,410 trees >or= 5 cm diameter, directly harvested in 27 study sites across the tropics. Proportional relationships between aboveground biomass and the product of wood density, trunk cross-sectional area, and total height are constructed. We also develop a regression model involving wood density and stem diameter only. Our models were tested for secondary and old-growth forests, for dry, moist and wet forests, for lowland and montane forests, and for mangrove forests. The most important predictors of AGB of a tree were, in decreasing order of importance, its trunk diameter, wood specific gravity, total height, and forest type (dry, moist, or wet). Overestimates prevailed, giving a bias of 0.5-6.5% when errors were averaged across all stands. Our regression models can be used reliably to predict aboveground tree biomass across a broad range of tropical forests.

Forest structure and dynamics vary across the Amazon Basin in an east-west gradient coincident with variations in soil fertility and geology. This has resulted in the hypothesis that soil fertility may play an important role in explaining Basin-wide variations in forest biomass, growth and stem turnover rates. Soil samples were collected in a total of 59 different forest plots across the Amazon Basin and analysed for exchangeable cations, carbon, nitrogen and pH, with several phosphorus fractions of likely different plant availability also quantified. Physical properties were additionally examined and an index of soil physical quality developed. Bivariate relationships of soil and climatic properties with above-ground wood productivity, stand-level tree turnover rates, above-ground wood biomass and wood density were first examined with multivariate regression models then applied. Both forms of analysis were undertaken with and without considerations regarding the underlying spatial structure of the dataset. Despite the presence of autocorrelated spatial structures complicating many analyses, forest structure and dynamics were found to be strongly and quantitatively related to edaphic as well as climatic conditions. Basin-wide differences in stand-level turnover rates are mostly influenced by soil physical properties with variations in rates of coarse wood production mostly related to soil phosphorus status. Total soil P was a better predictor of wood production rates than any of the fractionated organic- or inorganic-P pools. This suggests that it is not only the immediately available P forms, but probably the entire soil phosphorus pool that is interacting with forest growth on longer timescales. A role for soil potassium in modulating Amazon forest dynamics through its effects on stand-level wood density was also detected. Taking this into account, otherwise enigmatic variations in stand-level biomass across the Basin were then accounted for through the interacting effects of soil physical and chemical properties with climate. A hypothesis of self-maintaining forest dynamic feedback mechanisms initiated by edaphic conditions is proposed. It is further suggested that this is a major factor determining endogenous disturbance levels, species composition, and forest productivity across the Amazon Basin."

We have therefore developed a new global tropical forest database consisting of 39 955 concurrent H and D measurements encompassing 283 sites in 22 tropical countries. Utilising this database, our objectives were: 1. to determine if H:D relationships differ by geographic region and forest type (wet to dry forests, including zones of tension where forest and savanna overlap). 2. to ascertain if the H:D relationship is modulated by climate and/or forest structural characteristics (e.g. stand-level basal area, A). 3. to develop H:D allometric equations and evaluate biases to reduce error in future local-to-global estimates of tropical forest biomass. Annual precipitation coefficient of variation (PV), dry season length (SD), and mean annual air temperature (TA) emerged as key drivers of variation in H:D relationships at the pantropical and region scales. Vegetation structure also played a role with trees in forests of a high A being, on average, taller at any given D. After the effects of environment and forest structure are taken into account, two main regional groups can be identified. Forests in Asia, Africa and the Guyana Shield all have, on average, similar H:D relationships, but with trees in the forests of much of the Amazon Basin and tropical Australia typically being shorter at any given D than their counterparts elsewhere. The region-environment-structure model with the lowest Akaike's information criterion and lowest deviation estimated stand-level H across all plots to within amedian _2.7 to 0.9% of the true value. Some of the plot-to-plot variability in H:D relationships not accounted for by this model could be attributed to variations in soil physical conditions. Other things being equal, trees tend to be more slender in the absence of soil physical constraints, especially at smaller D. Pantropical and continental-level models provided less robust estimates of H, especially when the roles of climate and stand structure in modulating H:D allometry were not simultaneously taken into account."

Furthermore, there is no spaceborne remote sensing instrument that can measure tropical forest biomass directly. To determine the spatial distribution of forest biomass of the Amazon basin, we report a method based on remote sensing metrics representing various forest structural parameters and environmental variables, and more than 500 plot measurements of forest biomass distributed over the basin. A decision tree approach was used to develop the spatial distribution of AGLB for seven distinct biomass classes of lowland old-growth forests with more than 80% accuracy. AGLB for other vegetation types, such as the woody and herbaceous savanna and secondary forests, was directly estimated with a regression based on satellite data. Results show that AGLB is highest in Central Amazonia and in regions to the east and north, including the Guyanas. Biomass is generally above 300Mgha  1 here except in areas of intense logging or open floodplains. In Western Amazonia, from the lowlands of Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia to the Andean mountains, biomass ranges from 150 to 300Mgha  1 . Most transitional and seasonal forests at the southern and northwestern edges of the basin have biomass ranging from 100 to 200Mgha  1 .

The lowest proportion of IFL is found in Temperate Broadleaf and Mixed Forests. The IFL exist in 66 of the 149 countries that together make up the forest zone.

However, the absolute magnitude and environmental determinants of tropical forest biomass are still poorly understood. Here, we present a new synthesis and interpolation of the basal area and aboveground live biomass of old-growth lowland tropical forests across South America, based on data from 227 forest plots, many previously unpublished. Forest biomass was analyzed in terms of two uncorrelated factors: basal area and mean wood density. Basal area is strongly affected by local landscape factors, but is relatively invariant at regional scale in moist tropical forests, and declines significantly at the dry periphery of the forest zone. Mean wood density is inversely correlated with forest dynamics, being lower in the dynamic forests of western Amazonia and high in the slow-growing forests of eastern Amazonia. The combination of these two factors results in biomass being highest in the moderately seasonal, slow growing forests of central Amazonia and the Guyanas (up to 350?Mg?dry weight?ha?1) and declining to 200-250?Mg?dry weight?ha?1 at the western, southern and eastern margins. Overall, we estimate the total aboveground live biomass of intact Amazonian rainforests (area 5.76 x 106?km2 in 2000) to be 93+-23?Pg?C, taking into account lianas and small trees.

Although forest inventories often lack the species-level identifications favoured by tropical plant ecologists, their consistency of measurement and vast spatial coverage make them ideally suited for numerical analyses at large scales, and a valuable resource to describe the still poorly understood spatial variation of biomass, diversity, community composition and forest functioning across the South American tropics. Here we show, by using the seven forest inventories complemented with trait and inventory data collected elsewhere, two dominant gradients in tree composition and function across the Amazon, one paralleling a major gradient in soil fertility and the other paralleling a gradient in dry season length.

Here we present the first comprehensive spatial model of tree a-diversity and density in Amazonian rainforests, based on the largest-yet compilation of forest inventories and bolstered by a spatial interpolation technique that allows us to estimate diversity and density in areas that have never been inventoried. These data were then compared to continent-wide patterns of rainfall seasonality. We find that dry season length, while only weakly correlated with average tree a-diversity, is a strong predictor of tree density and of maximum tree a-diversity. The most diverse forests for any given dry season length are concentrated in a narrow latitudinal band just south of the equator, while the least diverse forests for any given dry season length are found in the Guayana Shield and Amazonian Bolivia. Denser forests are more diverse than sparser forests, even when we used a measure of diversity that corrects for sample size.

Methods Using height and diameter data from 20,497 trees in 112 non-contiguous plots, asymptotic maximum height (H AM) and heightÐdiameter relationships were computed with nonlinear mixed effects (NLME) models to: (1) test for environmental and structural causes of differences among plots, and (2) test if there were continental differences once environment and structure were accounted for; persistence of differences may imply the importance of biogeography for vertical forest structure. NLME analyses for floristic subsets of data (only/excluding Fabaceae and only/excluding Dipterocarpaceae individuals) were used to examine whether family-level patterns revealed biogeographical explanations of cross-continental differences. Results H AM and allometry were significantly different amongst continents. H AM was greatest in Asian forests (58.3 ± 7.5_m, 95% CI), followed by forests in Africa (45.1 ± 2.6_m), America (35.8 ± 6.0_m) and Australia (35.0 ± 7.4_m), and heightÐdiameter relationships varied similarly; for a given diameter, stems were tallest in Asia, followed by Africa, America and Australia. Precipitation seasonality, basal area, stem density, solar radiation and wood density each explained some variation in allometry and H AM yet continental differences persisted even after these were accounted for. Analyses using floristic subsets showed that significant continental differences in H AM and allometry persisted in all cases. Main conclusions Tree allometry and maximum height are altered by environmental conditions, forest structure and wood density. Yet, even after accounting for these, tropical forest architecture varies significantly from continent to continent. The greater stature of tropical forests in Asia is not directly determined by the dominance of the family Dipterocarpaceae, as on average non-dipterocarps are equally tall. We hypothesise that dominant large-statured families create conditions in which only tall species can compete, thus perpetuating a forest dominated by tall individuals from diverse families."

Previous comparisons of field-based estimates of the aboveground biomass (AGB) of trees greater than 10 cm diameter within Amazonia have been limited by the paucity of data for western Amazon forests, and the use of site-specific methods to estimate biomass from inventory data. In addition, the role of regional variation in stand-level wood specific gravity has not previously been considered. Using data from 56 mature forest plots across Amazonia, we consider the relative roles of species composition (wood specific gravity) and forest structure (basal area) in determining variation in AGB. 15.8% higher in forests in central and eastern, compared with northwestern Amazonia. This pattern is due to the higher diversity and abundance of taxa with high specific gravity values in central and eastern Amazonia, and the greater diversity and abundance of taxa with low specific gravity values in western Amazonia. For two estimates of AGB derived using different allometric equations, basal area explains 51.7% and 63.4%, and stand-level specific gravity 45.4% and 29.7%, of the total variation in AGB. The variation in specific gravity is important because it determines the regional scale, spatial pattern of AGB. When weighting by specific gravity is included, central and eastern Amazon forests have significantly higher AGB than stands in northwest or southwest Amazonia. The regional-scale pattern of species composition therefore defines a broad gradient of AGB across Amazonia.

A. Houghton"", ""K. T. Lawrence"", ""J. L. Hackler"", ""Sandra Brown""]"	"The amount of carbon released to the atmosphere as a result of deforestation is determined, in part, by the amount of carbon held in the biomass of the forests converted to other uses. Uncertainty in forest biomass is responsible for much of the uncertainty in current estimates of the flux of carbon from land-use change. In the present contribution several estimates of forest biomass are compared for the Brazilian Amazon, based on spatial interpolations of direct measurements, relationships to climatic variables, and remote sensing data. Three questions were posed: First, do the methods yield similar estimates? Second, do they yield similar spatial patterns of distribution of biomass? And, third, what factors need most attention if we are to predict more accurately the distribution of forest biomass over large areas? The answer to the first two questions is that estimates of biomass for Brazil's Amazonian forests (including dead and belowground biomass) vary by more than a factor of two, from a low of 39 PgC to a high of 93 PgC. Furthermore, the estimates disagree as to the regions of high and low biomass. The lack of agreement among estimates confirms the need for reliable determination of aboveground biomass over large areas. Potential methods include direct measurement of biomass through forest inventories with improved allometric regression equations, dynamic modelling of forest recovery following observed stand-replacing disturbances, and estimation of aboveground biomass from airborne or satellite-based instruments sensitive to the vertical structure plant canopies."

It is used to characterize species performance and fitness in community ecology and to compute tree and forest biomass in carbon cycle studies. While wood density has been historically measured at 12% moisture, it is convenient for ecological purposes to convert this measure to basic wood density, i.e., the ratio of dry mass over green volume. Basic wood density can then be used to compute tree dry biomass from living tree volume. Methods: Here, we derive a new exact formula to compute the basic wood density Db from the density at moisture content w denoted Dw, the fiber saturation point S, and the volumetric shrinkage coefficient R. We estimated a new conversion factor using a global wood technology database where values to use this formula are available for 4022 trees collected in 64 countries (mostly tropical) and representing 872 species. Key Results: We show that previous conversion factors used to convert densities at 12% moisture into basic wood densities are inconsistent. Based on theory and data, we found that basic wood density could be inferred from the density at 12% moisture using the following formula: Db = 0.828D12. This value of 0.828 provides basic wood density estimates 4-5% smaller than values inferred from previous conversion factors. Conclusions: This new conversion factor should be used to derive basic wood densities in global wood density databases.

To examine the important ecological and biogeo- chemical consequences of these changes, we are developing an international network, RAINFOR, which aims to monitor forest biomass and dynamics across Amazonia in a co-ordinated fashion in order to understand their relationship to soil and climate. The network will focus on sample plots established by independent researchers, some providing data extending back several decades. We will also conduct rapid transect studies of poorly monitored regions. Field expeditions ana- lysed local soil and plant properties in the first phase (2001- 2002). Initial results suggest that the network has the potential to reveal much information on the continental-scale relations between forest and environment.

We used records from multiple long-term monitoring plots across Amazonia to assess forest responses to the intense 2005 drought, a possible analog of future events. Affected forest lost biomass, reversing a large long-term carbon sink, with the greatest impacts observed where the dry season was unusually intense. Relative to pre-2005 conditions, forest subjected to a 100-millimeter increase in water deficit lost 5.3 megagrams of aboveground biomass of carbon per hectare. The drought had a total biomass carbon impact of 1.2 to 1.6 petagrams (1.2 x 10(15) to 1.6 x 10(15) grams).

GPG-LULUCF provides supplementary methods and good practice guidance for estimating, measuring, monitoring and reporting on carbon stock changes and greenhouse gas emissions from LULUCF activities under Article 3, paragraphs 3 and 4, and Articles 6 and 12 of the Kyoto Protocol. The GPG-LULUCF assists countries in producing inventories for the land use, land-use change and forestry sector that are neither over- nor underestimates so far as can be judged, and in which uncertainties are reduced as far as practicable. It supports the development of inventories that are transparent, documented, consistent over time, complete, comparable, assessed for uncertainties, subject to quality control and quality assurance, and efficient in the use of resources. The GPG-LULUCF is consistent with the existing good practice guidance for the other sector and addresses: ¥ Choice of estimation method within the context of the IPCC Guidelines; ¥ Quality assurance and quality control procedures to provide cross-checks during the inventory compilation; ¥ Data and information to be documented, archived and reported to facilitate review and assessment of inventory estimates; ¥ Quantification of uncertainties at the source or sink category level and for the inventory as a whole, so that resources available can be directed toward reducing uncertainties over time, and the improvement can be tracked. In addition, GPG-LULUCF provides guidance related to the specific features of the LULUCF sector on consistent representation of land areas, sampling for area estimates and for estimating emissions and removals, verification, and guidance on how to complement the Convention reporting for the LULUCF sector to meet the supplementary requirements under the Kyoto Protocol.

We investigated dopamine transporter binding in 61 subjects presenting with isolated atypical tremors defined as unilateral either postural, resting, or mixed (i.e. resting and postural) tremor, without rigidity or bradykinesia, by means of 123I-FPCIT SPECT imaging at baseline. Patients were followed-up clinically for 28.4 +/- 7.2 months. Twenty-five patients with baseline normal SPECT continued to present only tremor at follow-up. Among 36 patients with abnormal SPECT, 23 (64%) developed PD, while the remaining 13 continued to present only tremor at follow-up. The value of 123I-FPCIT SPECT in predicting the evolution to PD was very high in a way independent from the first clinical presentation of tremor (Rest tremor, P = 0.015; Mixed tremor, P = 0.015; Postural tremor, P = 0.039; chi-square test). Our data suggest that the clinical presentation of isolated tremors is insufficient to allow a precise early-stage diagnosis, whereas the detection of presynaptic nigrostriatal dopaminergic dysfunction could lead to diagnosis of atypical tremor disorders at a very early stage.

"[""Hiral LaRoia"", ""Elan D.

Given the very high population prevalence of ET, its possible role as a risk factor for PD and AD is of special significance. At the center of this debate is the burgeoning evidence from epidemiological studies, examining whether there is an increased co-occurrence of these conditions within the same individuals or within families. Methods: We conducted a PubMed search from 1966 to March 2011 and reviewed the epidemiological evidence, restricting our analyses to studies that generated quantifiable measures of association (odds ratios or relative risks), thereby being able to assess the role of chance. Results: The most robust evidence, from case-control, prospective and familial aggregation studies, indicates that ET is associated with increased odds and increased risks of both PD and AD. Conclusions: There is reasonable epidemiological evidence to support a link between ET and these neurodegenerative diseases. Further studies are needed to corroborate the current results, provide additional estimates of effect and begin to explore the mechanistic underpinnings for these intriguing associations."

Methods: SFMD were assessed by direct observation of symptoms in the year coincident (+/-6 months) with definite diagnosis of PD, DLB, Alzheimer disease, multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, or frontotemporal dementia, and by interviews with patients, caregivers, and general practitioners, and reviews of prior hospital admissions, in a cohort of 942 patients with neurodegenerative disorders. Matched groups of patients with PD and patients with DLB without vs with SFMD were selected for comparisons and followed up over 4 years. Results: The frequency of SFMD was higher in DLB (15 patients, 12%) and PD (29 patients, 7%) than in other neurodegenerative diseases (0%-3%). SFMD consisted of conversion motor or sensory disorders, often accompanied by delusional thought content; in one patient catatonic symptoms were observed concomitantly with PD diagnosis. Evidence of SFMD symptoms, preceding diagnosis by 6 months-10 years, was obtained in 28 patients with PD and all patients with DLB. A total of 22 patients with PD and all patients with DLB could be followed for 4 years. SFMD symptoms recurred during follow-up, with catatonic signs developing in 9 patients with PD and 8 patients with DLB. Most baseline demographic and clinical features did not differ between subjects with or without SFMD. Decline of cognitive function was greater in PD-SFMD patients than in those without SFMD (p < 0.01); it was comparable to that observed in DLB.

Although it has been suggested that variations in mean EEG frequency are greater in the former, the existence of meaningful differences remains controversial. No evidence is as yet available for Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD). The aim of this study was to evaluate whether EEG abnormalities can discriminate between DLB, AD and PDD in the earliest stages of dementia and to do this 50 DLB, 50 AD and 40 PDD patients with slight cognitive impairment at first visit (MMSE > or = 20) were studied. To improve clinical diagnostic accuracy, special emphasis was placed on identifying cognitive fluctuations and REM-sleep behaviour disorder. EEG variability was assessed by mean frequency analysis and compressed spectral arrays (CSA) in order to detect changes over time from different scalp derivations. Patients' initial diagnoses were revised at a 2-year follow-up visit with neuroimaging evaluation. Initial diagnoses were confirmed in 36 DLB, 40 AD and 35 PDD patients. The most relevant group differences were observed between the AD and DLB patients in EEGs from posterior derivations (P<0.001). Dominant frequencies were 8.3 +/- 0.6 Hz for the AD group and 7.4 +/- 1.6 Hz for the DLB group, in which most of the patients (88%) exhibited a frequency band of 5.6-7.9 Hz. Dominant frequency variability also differed between the AD (1.1 +/- 0.4 Hz) and DLB groups (1.8 +/- 1.2 Hz, P<0.001). Of note, less than a half (46%) of the patients with PDD exhibited the EEG abnormalities seen in those with DLB. Graded according to the presence of alpha activity, five different patterns were identified on EEG CSA from posterior derivations. A pattern with dominant alpha bands was observed in patients with AD alone while, in those with DLB and PDD, the degree to which residual alpha and 5.6-7.9 bands appeared was related to the presence and severity of cognitive fluctuations. At follow-up, EEG abnormalities from posterior leads were seen in all subjects with DLB and in three-quarters of those with PDD. Of interest, in four patients initially labelled as having AD, in whom the occurrence of fluctuations and/or REM-sleep behaviour disorder during the 2-year follow-up had made the diagnosis of AD questionable, the initial EEG was characterized by the features observed in the DLB group. If revised consensus criteria for DLB diagnosis are properly applied (i.e. emphasizing the diagnostic weight of fluctuations and REM sleep behaviour disorder), EEG recording may act to support discrimination between AD and DLB at the earliest stages of dementia, since characteristic abnormalities may even precede the appearance of distinctive clinical features."

"[""Mark Hallett"", ""G\u00fcnther Deuschl""]"	"In his essay on the Shaking Palsy,1 James Parkinson noted the presence of tremor as a cardinal feature: ""Involuntary tremulous motion, with lessened muscular power, in parts not in action and even when supported."" While superficially, tremor might seem to be a simple aspect of Parkinson's disease, it has actually turned out to be rather difficult to understand. One issue is that there is clearly more than one type of tremor. The classic"" tremor is tremor-at-rest; as Parkinson put it: ""in parts not in action"". The classic tremor might also be present in posture, although there might well be a pause in it during the transition from rest to posture. This has been called re-emergent tremor. Many patients, however, have a distinct postural tremor clearly different from re-emergent tremor. The distinction can come from the frequency which is often faster than tremor-at-rest or it can be present in some patients who lack tremor-at-rest. To be fair, however, sometimes it is difficult to tell whether it is truly different. A third postural tremor can be an essential tremor. There is sometimes a co-existence of essential tremor and Parkinson's disease, and, in this regard, it is now established that patients with essential tremor have a slightly higher chance of developing Parkinson's disease. Parkinson ""postural"" tremor and essential tremor can appear clinically very similar. Given that there are sometimes dystonic elements in Parkinson's disease, yet another possibility is a dystonic tremor, and, if present, it would also look similar to ""postural"" tremor and essential tremor. In this regard, recently it has been suggested that the SWEDD (scans without evidence of dopamine deficiency) patients have dystonic tremor.2 Moreover, any patient can have an exaggerated physiological tremor. Hence, there are at least five possible postural tremor types in patients. In order to understand the pathogenesis of postural tremor in Parkinson's disease, the first step should be a clear clinical characterization."

Furthermore, an association between ET and dementia has been reported in a single population-based study in Spain. This has not been confirmed elsewhere. Objective: To determine whether baseline ET is associated with prevalent and incident dementia in an ethnically diverse, community-based sample of elders. Methods: Community-dwelling elders in northern Manhattan were enrolled in a prospective cohort study. Baseline ET diagnoses were assigned from handwriting samples. Dementia was diagnosed at baseline and follow-up using DSM-III-R criteria. Results: In cross-sectional analyses, 31/124 (25.0%) ET cases had prevalent dementia vs 198/2,161 (9.2%) controls (odds ratio [OR]unadjusted = 3.31, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.15 - 5.09, p < 0.001; ORadjusted = 1.84, 95% CI = 1.13 - 2.98, p = 0.01). In prospective analyses, 17/93 (18.3%) ET cases vs 171/1,963 (8.7%) controls developed incident dementia (hazard ratio [HR]unadjusted = 2.78, 95% CI = 1.69 - 4.57, p < 0.001; HRadjusted = 1.64, 95% CI = 0.99 - 2.72, p = 0.055). Conclusions: In a second population-based study of elders, essential tremor (ET) was associated with both increased odds of prevalent dementia and increased risk of incident dementia. Presence of dementia, therefore, appeared to be greater than that expected for age (i.e., a disease-associated feature). Rather than attributing cognitive complaints in patients with ET to old age, assessment and possible treatment of dementia should be routinely incorporated into the treatment plan"	"The clarification of the different tremor types and response to treatment in DLB could improve clinical recognition of DLB, but mostly, understanding tremor in DLB, would provide clarity to recent controversial debates [16][17][18]#AUTHOR_TAG[20][21][22][23][24] on the long term outcome of patients putatively affected by ET."

D. Louis"", ""A. Agnew"", ""A. Gillman"", ""M. Gerbin"", ""A. S. Viner""]"	"Despite its high prevalence, there are surprisingly few prospective, longitudinal data on the clinical course of essential tremor (ET). Patients themselves often want to know from their treating physician whether and by how much their tremor is expected to worsen over time.As part of two research protocols, prospective, longitudinal data were collected on tremor severity in two samples of ET cases (44+39 cases, combined n=83). At a baseline and one follow-up evaluation, a detailed clinical assessment was performed and action tremor in the arms was rated by a senior movement disorders neurologist using a standardised clinical rating scale (Total Tremor Score (TTS), range 0-36).In the first case sample, TTS increased annually by 0.32 +- 0.89 points (ie, an annual increase of 5.3 +- 17.1% (median 1.8%) from the mean baseline score). TTS increased by >= 0.5 points in 23/24 (95.8%) cases followed for >= 5 years. In the second sample, TTS score increased annually by 0.64 +- 1.49 points (annual increase of 3.1 +- 8.1% (median 2.0%) from the mean baseline score). TTS increased by >= 0.5 points in 11/15 (73.3%) cases followed for >= 5 years. No baseline factors were identified that predicted annual change in TTS.Most ET cases exhibited a progressive worsening in tremor scores with time such that the average annual increase in tremor severity from baseline was estimated to be between 3.1% and 5.3% and the median annual increase from baseline was between 1.8% and 2.0%. These published estimates will hopefully be a useful prognostic guide for clinicians and their patients."

Rate of tremor progression was defined as tremor severity / duration. The degeneration index = number of torpedoes per section / Purkinje cell linear density. In the epidemiological study, older age of tremor onset was associated with faster rate of tremor progression (P < 0.001). In the brain repository, older age of tremor onset was associated with higher degeneration index (P = 0.037), and higher degeneration index was associated with faster rate of tremor progression (P = 0.018). In a large clinical sample, older age of onset was associated with more rapid tremor progression. In a brain bank, older age of onset was associated with more degenerative pathology in the cerebellum. As in several neurodegenerative disorders, in older onset cases, it is possible that the disease advances more rapidly.2009 Movement Disorder Society."

Additional data from a medical history and the results of a neurologic examination can be combined into one of the following clinical syndromes defined in this statement: enhanced physiologic tremor, classical essential tremor (ET), primary orthostatic tremor, task- and position-specific tremors, dystonic tremor, tremor in Parkinson's disease (PD), cerebellar tremor, Holmes' tremor, palatal tremor, drug-induced and toxic tremor, tremor in peripheral neuropathies, or psychogenic tremor. Conditions such as asterixis, epilepsia partialis continua, clonus, and rhythmic myoclonus can be misinterpreted as tremor. The features distinguishing these conditions from tremor are described.

This can occur as the result of various neurological dysfunctions, including changes in postural adjustments, loss of postural reflexes, axial akinesia and rigidity, freezing and/or postural hypotension. In some cases these symptoms remain unexplained, and rare cases of unsteadiness have been attributed to tremor on standing. To delineate this condition, we investigated 11 consecutive PD patients with unexplained unsteadiness because of tremor on standing, seen in our department over a 6-year period. All the patients had detailed clinical and electrophysiological investigations based on surface polygraphic electromyographic recordings. Four patients had fast orthostatic tremor (13-18 Hz), one had intermediate orthostatic tremor (8-9 Hz), and three had slow orthostatic tremor (4-6 Hz). The remaining 3 patients had orthostatic myoclonus, a condition that has not previously been reported in PD. Patients with fast tremor improved on clonazepam. Patients with slow tremor and myoclonus improved on levodopa and sometimes benefited further when clonazepam was added.

"[""R. C. Helmich"", ""M. Hallett"", ""G. Deuschl"", ""I. Toni"", ""B. R. Bloem""]"	"Tremor in Parkinson's disease has several mysterious features. Clinically, tremor is seen in only three out of four patients with Parkinson's disease, and tremor-dominant patients generally follow a more benign disease course than non-tremor patients. Pathophysiologically, tremor is linked to altered activity in not one, but two distinct circuits: the basal ganglia, which are primarily affected by dopamine depletion in Parkinson's disease, and the cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuit, which is also involved in many other tremors. The purpose of this review is to integrate these clinical and pathophysiological features of tremor in Parkinson's disease. We first describe clinical and pathological differences between tremor-dominant and non-tremor Parkinson's disease subtypes, and then summarize recent studies on the pathophysiology of tremor. We also discuss a newly proposed 'dimmer-switch model' that explains tremor as resulting from the combined actions of two circuits: the basal ganglia that trigger tremor episodes and the cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuit that produces the tremor.

It draws on the ideas of critical systems thinking (CST), a research perspective that encourages the analysis of stakeholdersÕ understandings prior to the selection and implementation of planning methods. The framework emphasizes continuous identification of concerns from stakeholders, and facilitates critical reflection in the exploration of possibilities for improvement. Some of these possibilities might require the support of IS and communication technologies. To define the framework, two systems theories are used: boundary critique and autopoiesis. The first one enables critical reflection on values and assumptions about potential situations or marginalization. The second one fosters continuous dialogue, listening and mutual collaboration between participants. With these theories, the framework enables people to reflect on issues of inclusion, exclusion and marginalization, and to participate in the design of plans for improvement. Ultimately, the definition of this framework suggests the importance of critical reflection about ethics to improve the practice of IS planning."

This paper aims to illustrate that if Free and/or Open Source Software is to be used as a building block to bridge the ""digital divide"" a more social and environmental perspective, which embraces the philosophy behind the software, needs to complement the technical perspective. The human environmental model is presented as a useful alternative which, if embraced, can inform more holistic information and communication technology (ICT) policies. Design/methodology/approach - Through a review of diffusion of innovations models an alternative diffusion framework is described and applied to an interpretive open source case study in South Africa. Findings - Contemporary diffusion and innovation models are narrowly focused on IT as a purely technological linear phenomenon. This perspective also underlies many ICT policies. A more socio-technical adoption model can assist in providing amore holistic approach to ICTpolicy development. Originality/value - The application of a new innovation model, the human environmental model, to ICT policy provides a holistic framework in which the complexity of the innovation process can be reflected in policy.

IntroductionThis paper presents an evaluation of an interpretive in-depth case study. It uses Myers (1997) for the evaluation. The conventions for evaluating information systems case studies conducted according to the natural science model of social science are now widely accepted. Benbasat et al (1987), Lee (1989) and Yin (1994) formulated a set of methodological principles for case studies that were consistent with the conventions of positivism. As a result, case study research is now accepted as a valid research strategy within the Information System research community. The principles proposed in their work have become the de-facto standard against which most case study research in information systems is evaluated. However, while their criteria are useful in evaluating case study research conducted according to the natural science model of social science, the positivist criteria they suggest are inappropriate for interpretive research.The use of interpretive approach is relatively new to information systems field, the approach has emerged as a valid and important strand in information systems research and most mainstream IS journals now welcome interpretive research and significant groups of authors are working within the interpretive tradition (Walsham, 1995). One of the main aims of interpretive research is seeking meaning in context. The use of interpretive perspective can help researchers to understand human thought and action in social and organisational contexts. It has the potential to produce deep insights into information systems phenomena including the use and the management of information systems. The interpretive research does not subscribe to the idea that a pre-determined set of criteria can be applied in a mechanistic way, it does not follow that there are no standards at all by which interpretive research can be judged.Striving and ensuring rigor in interpretive study requires different criteria through which one views and judges the quality and completeness of the research process. Many researchers (Orlikowski et al, 1991; Walsham, 1993, 1995; Klein and Myers, 1999) have addressed qualitative research and they have shown how the nature and purpose of interpretive research differs from positivist research. At present, there are no agreed criteria for evaluating research of this kind. Nonetheless, there must be some criteria by which the quality of interpretive research can be evaluated. Myers (1997) and Klein and Myers (1999) have proposed a set of criteria for the conduct and evaluation of interpretive research in information systems.This study is not concerned with adhering to the scientific tenets of precision and replication, instead the study is concerned in seeking a theory that is compatible with evidence that is both rigorous and relevant and generally useful to other areas. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. It begins with an overview of case study method and a discourse on the use of case study in Information Systems. This will be followed by a description of the procedures involved in collecting and analyzing data in grounded theory method. Then the criteria proposed by Myers (1997) for evaluating interpretive research will be discussed in relation to this particular study. Myers suggests that interpretive research can be evaluated in terms of theory and in terms of data. Finally, the paper presents further research and some conclusions2. Methodology2.1 Case studyThe purpose of using case study was to provide an understanding of the factors that influence Small to Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) decision to adopt and use Internet in business. The aims of using case study are: (1) to elicit qualitative information (2) to produce an in-depth and holistic study (Yin, 1994), that gives the reader sufficient contextual and environmental descriptions to allow them to transfer the case studies based on conceptual applicability. The case studies are reported with sufficient detail and precision to allow judgements about transferability. ..."

CCT387	211327317	Towards a Framework for Decision Making Regarding IT Adoption	Osden Jokonya	Societal Learning and Change How Governments Business and Civil Society are Creating Solutions to Complex Multi stakeholder Problems	"[""S Waddell""]"	"Constructing roads in Madagascar; forestry along Canada's Pacific Coast; water and sanitation projects in South Africa; community banking in the United States; constructing a new global system for corporate reporting. These all have something in common. They provide great illustrations of the types of profound and wise changes needed in the way we run our affairs if we are to respond to the scale of environmental and social challenges and opportunities facing us. They are examples of ""societal learning and change"". Today, this phenomenon is occurring across industries as diverse as resources extraction, infrastructure development, agriculture and information technology at the local, national, regional and global levels. Its essence involves the ability to create rich relationships that bridge large differences. This book describes this phenomenon for practitioners to help them address issues and develop opportunities more effectively. Building on the traditions of individual and organizational learning, this book suggests that our challenge is to create learning societies and processes. This involves both change in ourselves as individuals, but also change in the way the three key systems that make up our societies Ð the political system (government), economic system (business) and social system (civil society) Ð function by creating more robust interactions that respond to human and environmental imperatives rather than organizational ones. Societal Learning and Change presents a meta-framework that covers diverse approaches, including corporate citizenship, social responsibility, community development, private-public partnerships, inter-sectoral collaboration and sustainability strategies. It makes sense of all of these by emphasising that they all share the need to change relationships at the societal level and explaining how to do this from a systems perspective. The book helps overcome the conundrum where individual organisations are unsuccessfully trying to achieve big change with their stakeholders. Rather than stakeholder management with an organization-centric viewpoint, this book describes the importance of taking a stakeholder engagement and issue/opportunity-centric strategy. Wherever you are, you can make a contribution to shifting the paradigm through a societal learning and change strategy. The critical contribution is creating new relationships between people and organizations that traditionally would not interact but in fact have common interests. When these relationships become meaningful by addressing a problem or developing an opportunity, people begin to learn about each other and develop mutual appreciation and understanding. Often this process is complicated and confusing. People do not use words in the same way even if they speak the same formal language; they do not learn or perceive the world the same way although they may share a common culture; their organizations have diverse goals, resources and weaknesses that make working together problematic. However, it is these very differences that are the source of the value of working together. Societal Learning and Change aims to make it easier to solve differences in order to work together successfully; it does this by identifying some of the differences as sources of tension and opportunity and describing the development processes of building relationships that can produce mutually rewarding innovation that is unimaginable when the relationship begins. This is an extremely optimistic book at a time of great pessimism about the huge forces of globalization and corporate power that seem to be overwhelming us. It will be essential reading for students and practitioners in the fields of organizational learning, sustainability, poverty, international development and stakeholder relations."

IT governance involves specifying decision rights and accountabilities for important IT decisions. The goal is to encourage ""desirable behaviors"" in the use of IT. In studying the IT governance of more than 250 enterprises in 23 countries, we found a wide array of IT governance arrangements. Enterprises assign ""decision rights"" to different ""archetypes"" (Business or IT Monarchy, Federal, Duopoly, Feudal, or Anarchy) to govern five key IT decisions (IT investment, architecture, principles, application needs, and infrastructure). Top-performing enterprises govern IT differently from each other and from average enterprises. Firms leading on growth decentralize more of their IT decision rights and place IT capabilities in the business units. Those leading on profit centralize more decision rights; senior business leaders make the major IT decisions. Top performers design their IT governance to reinforce their performance goals and link IT governance to the governance of their other key enterprise assets and desired behaviors.

Therefore IT platform decisions need to be made in a mindful manner because of the high degree of investment risk. However, more aggressive migrations, compared to the global trend, to an open system have been observed in Korean organizations. This phenomenon defies the common understanding of IT investment risk and encourages the investigation of the elusive characteristics underlying IT investment decisions. The effect of IT decision-makers' perceptions and risk propensity on their IT platform migration decisions is examined in the context of risky decisions. In addition to risk perception, decision-makers' risk propensity also has a significant effect on IT investment decisions.

We were particularly interested to discover what project management practices are common in Australian software projects. The relationship between practices and software project outcomes enables us to investigate why some projects succeed and others fail. We found that nearly 20% of projects had no lifecycle methodology and 10% of our respondents did not understand what was meant by a software development lifecycle methodology. Many recognized software practices are not being applied consistently in the projects investigated. Fifty percent of projects began with unclear requirements. Risk assessment is not normally a part of the development process and the organizations are not learning from their mistakes as post mortem reviews are much more likely to be held for successful projects than they are for unsuccessful projects.

In this paper secondary data is used in a linear programming model to test this hypothesis by calculating the potential loss in farm level optimal returns. The model is static with a time frame of two production seasons. Linear crop-water quality production functions (Ayers & Westcot, 1983; adapted from Maas & Hoffmann, 1977) are used to calculate net returns for the eight most common crops grown. Results show optimal enterprise composition under various water quality situations. Leaching is justified financially and there is a strong motivation for a change in the current water pricing system. SALMOD (Salinity and Leaching Model for Optimal irrigation Development) is the Excel Solver model used to derive the preliminary results, but is currently being developed further in GAMS (General Algebraic Modelling System).

In a very real sense, people judge the success or failure of any product by the extent to which it is used by intended users in their daily practice. Understanding a product from the perspective of the end-user is one of the most important and often overlooked keys to the success of any project. Many products suffer from a lack of widespread utilization because developers and managers often have a deterministic view of the relationship between technology and users. This deterministic view leads to an over reliance on technical specifications as the driving force in the end usersÕ decision to adopt and use a product. However, a wide variety of human, organizational, social, and cultural factors also affect the acceptance and use of any product. Any organization, even those in the most highly technical and advanced fields, is, in reality, a dynamic example of a sociotechnical system in which people and machines interact, negotiate usage, compete for primacy, and generally co-exist. This chapter will provide a broad theoretical overview of the critical role that end-users play in the adoption, implementation, utilization, and institutionalization of any technology. A number of relevant theories will be discussed, including diffusion theory (e.g., Rogers, 1995), technological determinism (e.g., Ellul, 1967), sociotechnical systems (e.g., Volti, 2006), and utopian and dystopian philosophical perspectives (e.g., Rubin, 1996). In addition to a theoretical overview, this chapter will provide practical recommendations for developers and managers who wish to increase the utilization of their products by bringing the user into the development process. The practical recommendations will include a discussion of ElyÕs (1999) conditions that facilitate the implementation of innovations. These conditions include developing a sense of dissatisfaction with the status quo, providing sufficient time to become familiar with a new technology, and generating meaningful commitment to the project by upper level managers. Also included in the practical recommendations will be a brief discussion of various organizational components that enable the introduction of innovations (Surry, Ensminger, & Haab, 2005). These components include the development and maintenance of an adequate infrastructure of supporting technologies, an emphasis on shared decision making, and ongoing support systems. Other recommendations to be discussed in this chapter will be derived from rapid prototyping models of development (e.g., Tripp & Bichelmeyer, 1990) and recent surveys of user-centered design methods."

I pay particular attention to the theory and measurement of voluntary associations in promoting trust, hypothesizing that voluntary associations connected to other voluntary associations are more beneficial for the creation of generalized trust than associations isolated from other associations. The theory is tested with a multi-level, cross-national model, including both individual-level and country-level variables to predict the placement of trust. At the individual level, I find that membership in connected associations creates more trust than membership in isolated associations.

The Debate about the Alleged Decline of Social Capital and Civic Engagement in Western Societies"	"[""DIETLIND STOLLE"", ""MARC HOOGHE""]"	"In his 1790 address to the AcadŽmie Franaise in Paris, Condorcet noted that every new generation has a tendency to accuse itself of being less civic-minded than previous cohorts. Two centuries later, this argument has once again regained front-page status. The debate is currently focused on the question of whether or not social capital and civic engagement are declining in Western societies. In his academic best-seller Bowling Alone, Robert Putnam argues that younger age cohorts, socialized in the prosperous economic conditions of the 1960s and onwards, are less inclined to engage in community life and in politics, and also less likely to trust their fellow citizens. By contrast, the Ôlong civic generationÕ, born roughly between 1910 and 1940, is portrayed as much more motivated in these respects. They readily volunteer in community projects, read newspapers and take on more social responsibilities. In this view, a process of generational replacement is responsible for a steady decline of social capital and civic engagement in American society. As the long civic generation is replaced by younger age cohorts, the social capital stock of American communities slowly diminishes. The indicators used to substantiate this claim are numerous and diverse: measures for voter turnout, attendance of club meetings, generalized trust, the number of common family dinners, the number of card games played together, and even respect for traffic rules. All of these attitudes and behaviours, it is argued, depict a significant downward trend. Although Putnam is by far the most vocal of all scholars in the Ôdecline of social capitalÕ choir, he certainly is not the only author describing an erosion of traditional societal relations."

This combination is most marked in the high trust Nordic countries but the same general pattern is found in the remaining 55 countries, albeit in a weaker form. Rural societies have comparatively low levels of generalized trust but large-scale urban societies do not.Cause and effect relations are impossible to specify exactly but ethnic homogeneity and Protestant traditions seem to have a direct impact on trust, and an indirect one through their consequences for good government, wealth and income equality.

Benny Geys	"Institutions, Institutional Change and Economic Performance"	"[""D C North""]"	"Continuing his groundbreaking analysis of economic structures, Douglass North develops an analytical framework for explaining the ways in which institutions and institutional change affect the performance of economies, both at a given time and over time. Institutions exist, he argues, due to the uncertainties involved in human interaction; they are the constraints devised to structure that interaction. Yet, institutions vary widely in their consequences for economic performance; some economies develop institutions that produce growth and development, while others develop institutions that produce stagnation. North first explores the nature of institutions and explains the role of transaction and production costs in their development. The second part of the book deals with institutional change. Institutions create the incentive structure in an economy, and organisations will be created to take advantage of the opportunities provided within a given institutional framework. North argues that the kinds of skills and knowledge fostered by the structure of an economy will shape the direction of change and gradually alter the institutional framework. He then explains how institutional development may lead to a path-dependent pattern of development. In the final part of the book, North explains the implications of this analysis for economic theory and economic history. He indicates how institutional analysis must be incorporated into neo-classical theory and explores the potential for the construction of a dynamic theory of long-term economic change. Douglass C. North is Director of the Center of Political Economy and Professor of Economics and History at Washington University in St. Louis. He is a past president of the Economic History Association and Western Economics Association and a Fellow, American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He has written over sixty articles for a variety of journals and is the author of The Rise of the Western World: A New Economic History (CUP, 1973, with R.P.

The second concern is analytical: what are the main political, economic, and cultural factors driving the dynamics of support for democratic government?

Here, research on social cohesion and social embeddedness is linked by developing a concept of structural cohesion based on network node connectivity. Structural cohesion is defined as the minimum number of actors who, if removed from a group, would disconnect the group. A structural dimension of embeddedness can then be defined through the hierarchical nesting of these cohesive structures.

Although less dramatic than abrupt and wholesale transformations, these slow and piecemeal changes can be equally consequential for patterning human behavior and for shaping substantive political outcomes. Consider, for example, the British House of Lords. This is an institution that began to take shape in the thirteenth century out of informal consultations between the Crown and powerful landowners. By the early nineteenth century, membership was hereditary and the chamber was fully institutionalized at the center of British politics. Who would have thought that this deeply undemocratic assembly of aristocrats would survive the transition to democracy? Not the early Labour Party, which was founded in 1900 and understandably committed to the elimination of a chamber from which its constituents were, more or less by definition, excluded. Yet Labour did not dismantle the House of Lords Ð despite recurring opportunities to do so during the twentieth century. Instead, the institution was reformed over time in a series of more measured moves that, successively: circumscribed its powers (especially in 1911 by a Liberal Party government), altered its composition (especially in 1958 under a Conservative government, with the addition of life peerages), and rendered it less unwieldy and Ð in the eyes of some Ð more legitimate (in 2000 under a Labour government, by reducing dramatically the number of hereditary peers)."

This book brings together a distinguished set of contributors from a variety of disciplines to examine current theories of institutional change. The chapters highlight the limitations of these theories, finding them lacking in the analytic tools necessary to identify the changes occurring at a national level, and therefore tend to explain many changes and innovation as simply another version of previous situations.    Instead a model emerges of contemporary political economies developing in incremental but cumulatively transformative processes. The contributors show that a wide, but not infinite, variety of models of institutional change exist which can meaningfully distinguished and analytically compared. They offer an empirically grounded typology of modes of institutional change that offer important insights on mechanisms of social and political stability, and evolution generally.    Beyond Continuity provides a more complex and fundamental understanding of institutional change, and will be important reading for academics, researchers, and advanced students of Political Science, Management Studies, Sociology, and Economics.Introduction: Convergence or Diversity?

We examine changes in trust by attempting to estimate age, period, and cohort effects. We find a nonlinear aging effect: Trust is lowest among the youngest Americans, increases up to middle age, and then levels off. We also find over-time decreases in U.S. trust. These may stem from a nonlinear cohort effect: Generations born up to the 1940s exhibit high levels of trust, but each generation born after that is less trusting than the one before. We argue that some of the over-time decline might also stem from an age-specific period effect: Beginning in the 1980s the trust of young and middle-aged Americans declined steadily. We note that if successive generations continue to be less and less trusting, then through a process of cohort replacement U.S. society will become pervaded by mistrust."

Data on social capital in informal social networks are harder to obtain and there has also been insufficient means for investigating this. In this paper, we use the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) to conceptualise and measure three types of social capital: neighbourhood attachment, social network and civic participation. The first two refer to informal social networks and the last to formal social networks. We use gllamm (Generalized Linear Latent and Mixed Models) to construct the latent variable scores from the categorical component variables. We also analyse the socio-cultural determinants of the three types of social capital and their impacts on social trust. The results show that socio-cultural conditions affect social capital generation. People in disadvantaged positions are more likely to draw social capital from weak ties and those in advantaged positions are more likely to do so from formal civic engagement. We also find that social capital has an effect over and above peopleÕs own socio-cultural positions. Informal social networks, especially having good neighbourly relations, tend to foster greater trust than does formal civic engagement."

In the first part of the paper, we develop a typology of voluntary associations based on theoretical considerations and previous empirical analyses of the primary concerns of these voluntary associations: leisure organizations fulfil recreational purposes, interest organizations aim to represent the interests of their members, and activist organizations advocate broad societal interests. We present a measure that is cross-nationally equivalent. The second part of the paper illustrates the validity and relevance of the typology for studies of associational involvement. First, the Mokken scale analysis shows that the repertoire of activities (membership, participation, volunteering, and donating money) that citizens employ differs across the three types. Second, cross-national analysis shows that the ratio between involvement rate and the share of volunteers in voluntary associations differs across the three types. Finally, the three types of associations are differently related to the (supposed) causes and consequences of associational involvement. We illustrate that many of these differences cancel each other out when we do not distinguish between leisure, interest and activist organizations. All in all, this article proves that the distinction between leisure, interest, and activist organizations has significant, substantial, and theoretically relevant outcomes.15 p"	"Nonetheless, the same might likewise hold for other distinctions recently proposed in the literature: e.g., the bridging/bonding distinction based on the socio-demographic diversity of an association's memberships (see Coffé & Geys, 2007;Putnam, 2000;Stolle & Rochon, 1998), the inclusive/exclusive distinction based on associations' constitutive purposes (Geys & Griesshaber, 2012;Warren, 2001Warren, , 2004Zmerli, 2003), or the typology based on associations' 'primary concerns' (i.e., recreational, members' interests, or broad social interests; see #AUTHOR_TAG, Te Grotenhuis, & Scheepers, 2009)."

Trends in Political Involvement and Participation in Norway, 1965?2001"	"[""Ola Listhaug"", ""Lars Gr\u00f8nflaten""]"	"Electoral turnout in Norway has been declining over a long period for local elections and, at the four most recent Storting elections, turnout has been at a lower level than in the preceding 25 years. This article investigates whether the fall in turnout generalises to other forms of political participation and political involvement. Data from the Norwegian Election Studies 1965Ð2001 and the Norwegian Values Studies 1982Ð1996 are analysed. In contrast to the decline of turnout, the authors find that the broader political activity of citizens has increased. The rise in political involvement and activism is quite widespread, covering dimensions like political interest, political discussion and political action. The increase includes forms of participation where political parties play a strong role and in direct action where parties are supposed to be less important. Education is strongly associated with most forms of civic participation and the rise in educational levels normally leads to an increase in participation rates. Data show that women are now as active as men in most dimensions of participation. In Norway, turnout at elections displays one pattern over time, while other indicators of political participation and involvement show different trajectories. There is no general civic decline. Using political involvement and participation as a criterion for judging the state of democracy, and taking into account the whole set of indicators studied in this article, one may reasonably conclude that Norwegian civic democracy is in better health than if one focused only on the fall in electoral turnout."

Benny Geys	Union Members and Voluntary Associations: Membership Overlap as a Case of Organizational Embeddedness	"[""Benjamin Cornwell"", ""Jill Ann Harrison""]"	"Prevailing conceptions of organizational embeddedness emphasize linkages to exchange partners via elites and contracts. What is neglected, the authors argue, is the nature and potential impact from the voluntary associations of rank-and-file members with the panoply of organizations in their daily lives, including churches, PTAs, and sports teams. The functions of these organizations provide contexts in which individuals trade information and form opinions about organizations and their members. By participating, individuals embed their own organizations in a broader organizational culture. This article treats the embeddedness of unions in the interorganizational network as a factor that has impacted and varied with the decline of organized labor. Organizational affiliation networks containing 18,263 individuals, drawn from the 1974-1994 General Social Survey data, show the isolation of unions in American organizational culture despite their relatively high rates of membership. Chronic aspects of the problem include union members' lack of nonunion voluntary association membership in general and the particularly low embeddedness of the organizations with which they affiliate."

Benny Geys	Shaping the Political Arena	"[""R B Collier"", ""D Collier""]"	"This dissertation examines the processes and outcomes of welfare regimes reforms in eleven Latin American countries, between 1980 and 2010. It theorizes the reforms by comparing pensions, health care, and social assistance policies.  In so doing, it confronts three theoretical goals. First, it provides an explanation of recent transformations of welfare regimes as resulting from the combined effects of gradual institutional change and exogenous socioeconomic transformations. Second, it explores the potentialities and limitations of historical institutionalism. Third, it identifies emerging patterns of governance.   Mismatches between institutions and social problems trigger reforms, but do not determine the options that policy makers finally choose. Frictions caused by emerging social risks interact with difficulties of established welfare regimes to cope with old risks to facilitate access to public agendas for reformist projects. Ultimately, however, reforms depend on the construction of pro-and anti-reform coalitions, shaped by two main forces: 1) lines of discrimination in the distribution of benefits by existing welfare regimes; 2) strategies of parties, interest groups, and bureaucracies, competing to activate those cleavages according to their interests.  Socioeconomic change, fiscal strain, and transnational factors, interact to make the expansion of social protection contingent upon redistributions of burdens and benefits guaranteed to trigger resistance from groups privileged by existing schemes. The strategic challenge for reformist politicians is the crafting of formulas aimed at simultaneously neutralizing potential veto coalitions and mobilizing unprotected populations. This requires combining strategies of blame-avoidance and credit-claiming that variably mix persuasion, exclusion, and division targeting potential opposition. Selective pay-offs to appease privileged groups constitute the most direct determinants of the architecture of reforms.   In explaining the reforms, I discuss endogenous institutional change and how this results in fragmented social protection policies.

We do this by relating responses to the standard trust question to a new battery of items that measures in-group and out-group trust. In 41 out of 51 countries, Òmost peopleÓ in the standard question predominantly connotes out-groups. To this extent, it is a valid measure of general trust in others. Nevertheless, the radius of Òmost peopleÓ varies considerably across countries; it is substantially narrower in Confucian countries and wider in wealthy countries. Some country rankings on trust thus change dramatically when the standard question is replaced by a radius-adjusted trust score. In cross-country regressions, the radius of trust matters for civic attitudes and behaviors because the assumed civic nature of trust depends on a wide radius."

Benny Geys	Hunkering down in multi ethnic neighbourhoods The effects of ethnic diversity in cities and neighbourhoods on dimensions of social cohesion	"["" Gijsberts""]"	"Putnam (2007) claims that in ethnically diverse neighbourhoods, residents of all ethnic groups tend to Ôhunker downÕ. Solidarity and trust are lower, mutual help and cooperation rarer, and friends fewer. Various studies in the United States found a clear correlation between diversity and cohesion, and also for many different dimensions of social cohesion. Whether this finding also holds in other (European) settings is the subject of hot and unresolved debate. Specifically, this article addresses the question of whether living in an ethnically diverse setting has negative consequences for social cohesion in the Netherlands as well. Previous studies on the Netherlands remained inconclusive. We examine how this lack of consensus can be explained. To further the debate, this article pulls apart various contexts and various dimensions of social cohesion. This article examines the relationship between ethnic diversity (in socio-graphically defined neighbourhoods) and four dimensions of social cohesion (trust, informal help, voluntary work, and neighbourhood contacts) for the 50 largest cities in the Netherlands. We conclude that the Putnam hypothesis holds only to a limited extent in the Dutch context. The only aspect on which ethnic diversity has a negative effect is the degree of contact in the neighbourhood."

Benny Geys	Civil Society and the Collapse of the Weimar Republic	"[""Sheri Berman""]"	"Practically everywhere one looks these days the concept of ""civil society"" is in vogue. Neo-Tocquevillean scholars argue that civil society plays a role in driving political, social, and even economic outcomes. This new conventional wisdom, however, is flawed. It is simply not true that democratic government is always strengthened, not weakened, when it faces a vigorous civil society. This essay shows how a robust civil society helped scuttle the twentieth century's most critical democratic experiment, Weimar Germany. An important implication of this analysis is that under certain circumstances associationism and the prospects for democratic stability can actually be inversely related. To know when civil society activity will take on oppositional or even antidemocratic tendencies, one needs to ground one's analyses in concrete examinations of political reality. Political scientists should remember that Tocqueville considered Americans' political associations to be as important as their nonpolitical ones, and they should therefore examine more closely the connections between the two under various conditions."

Blackburn, Julie L. Lockwood, Phillip Cassey 2009. All rights reserved. As people have spread around the world, they have taken with them a broad range of other species to satisfy a variety of human needs. Some of these species went on to establish wild populations well outside their native ranges. These biological invaders are a major component of current global change, and often represent threats to the maintenance of global biodiversity, human health, and the success of human economic enterprises. The continuing globalization of our society ensures that the need to understand the process of biological invasion will only increase in the future. There is also a growing recognition that the study of biological invaders provides significant insight into basic questions in ecology and evolution. Exotic birds provide a particularly good opportunity to study the causes and consequences of biological invasions. By combining good historical records of bird introductions with the detailed information available on many other aspects of avian biology, this book advances understanding of the invasion process while also exploring avian conservation biology, and basic principles of ecology and evolution. Chapters cover causes of non-randomness in which species get transported and released into novel environments, the stochastic (relating to numbers released) and deterministic (relating to species and location) effects that influence establishment success, patterns and processes in range expansion, and the ecology, genetics, and evolution of exotic birds in their new environment"	"4.59 km year À1 , derived from #AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2009) multiplied by the number of years since introduction (see Strubbe et al., 2013 for details)."

Pearman"", ""Manuela D'Amen"", ""Catherine H. Graham"", ""Wilfried Thuiller"", ""Niklaus E.

These patterns of within-species niche variation raise the question of whether these differences should be considered when developing models for predicting the potential effects of climate change on species distributions. We address this question with two divergent datasets, one on sister species and subspecies from the European herpetofauna, the other on subspecies of breeding birds in North America. Atlas and observation data come from the Atlas of Amphibians and Reptiles in Europe and the North American Breeding Bird Survey, respectively. We develop boosted regression tree models of climateÐdistribution relationships and project the predicted geographic range of each taxon using interpolated weather station data and modeled climate for the year 2080. We find differences between models that distinguish the contributions of subtaxa and those that do not, in terms of prediction of both current and future distributions. In comparison to models that ignore sub-taxon structure, models that incorporate this structure generally predict larger areas of suitable conditions, consistently perform better, if only marginally, as measured by cross-validated AUC, and can reveal divergent potential effects of climate change on subtaxa. Differences in niche occupancy and predicted distribution appear between closely related taxa regardless of their phylogenetic distinctness. For these reasons, information on subtaxon membership and phylogeographic structure should be included in modeling exercises when available, in order to identify both the contribution of these units to the niche occupancy of species and the potentially distinct responses of subtaxa to climate change."

Our goal was to test risk assessment performance across a range of taxonomic and geographical scales, at different points in the invasion process, with a range of statistical and machine learning algorithms.        Location  Regional to global data sets.        Methods  We selected six data sets differing in size, geography and taxonomic scope. For each data set, we created seven risk assessment tools using a range of statistical and machine learning algorithms. Performance of tools was compared to determine the effects of data set size and scale, the algorithm used, and to determine overall performance of the trait-based risk assessment approach.        Results  Risk assessment tools with good performance were generated for all data sets. Random forests (RF) and logistic regression (LR) consistently produced tools with high performance. Other algorithms had varied performance. Despite their greater power and flexibility, machine learning algorithms did not systematically outperform statistical algorithms. Geographic scope of the data set, and size of the data set, did not systematically affect risk assessment performance.        Main conclusions  Across six representative data sets, we were able to create risk assessment tools with high performance. Additional data sets could be generated for other taxonomic groups and regions, and these could support efforts to prevent the arrival of new invaders.

Furthermore, little is known about the factors that contribute to niche shifts when they occur.

Location    Global except the Antarctic.        Methods    We assessed climatic niche dynamics in a gridded environmental space that allowed niche overlap and expansion into climatic conditions not colonized by the species in their native range to be quantified. We analysed the factors that affect niche shifts using a model-averaging approach, based on generalized linear mixed-effects models.        Results    Approximately 57% of the invaded ranges (amphibians, 51%; reptiles, 61%) showed niche shifts (>= 10% expansion in the realized climatic niche). Island endemics, species introduced to Oceania and invaded ranges outside the native biogeographical realm all showed a higher proportion of niche shifts. Niche shifts were more likely for species that had smaller native range sizes, were introduced earlier into a new range or invaded areas located at lower latitudes than the native range.        Main conclusions     The proportion of niche shifts for non-native herpetofauna was higher than those for Holarctic non-native plants and European non-native birds.

Sax""]"	"Copyright (c) 2014 WileyAim: Correlative models that forecast extinction risk from climate change and invasion risks following species introductions, depend on the assumption that species' current distributions reflect their climate tolerances ('climatic equilibrium'). This assumption has rarely been tested with independent distribution data, and studies that have done so have focused on species that are widespread or weedy in their native range. We use independent data to test climatic equilibrium for a broadly representative group of species, and ask whether there are any general indicators that can be used to identify when equilibrium occurs. Location: Europe and contiguous USA. Methods: We contrasted the climate conditions occupied by 51 plant species in their native (European) and naturalized (USA) distributions by applying kernel smoothers to species' occurrence densities. We asked whether species had naturalized in climate conditions that differ from their native ranges, suggesting climatic disequilibrium in the native range, and whether characteristics of species' native distributions correspond with climatic equilibrium. Results: A large proportion of species' naturalized distributions occurred outside the climatic conditions occupied in their native ranges: for 22 species, the majority of their naturalized ranges fell outside their native climate conditions. Our analyses revealed large areas in Europe that species do not occupy, but which match climatic conditions occupied in the USA, suggesting a high degree of climatic disequilibrium in the native range. Disequilibrium was most severe for species with native ranges that are small and occupy a narrow range of climatic conditions. Main conclusions: Our results demonstrate that the direct effects of climate on species distributions have been widely overestimated, and that previous large-scale validations of the equilibrium assumption using species' native and naturalized distributions are not generally applicable. Non-climatic range limitations are likely to be the norm, rather than the exception, and pose added risks for species under climate change.Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Technologi"	"Two large scale studies on European plants introduced to North America found niche conservatism was the dominant pattern for weedy, widespread plant species (Petitpierre et al., 2012), while niche expansion into climates not occupied in the native range was common for plants with smaller native ranges (#AUTHOR_TAG & Sax, 2014)."

Based on the occurrence of 28 non-native birds in Europe, we assess to what extent Grinnellian realized niches are conserved during invasion, formulate hypotheses to explain the variation in observed niche changes and test how well species distribution models can predict non-native bird occurrence in Europe. Location Europe. Methods To quantify niche changes, a recent method that applies kernel smoothers to densities of species occurrence in a gridded environmental space was used. This corrects for differences in the availability of environments between study areas and allows discrimination between 'niche expansion' into environments new to the species and 'niche unfilling', whereby the species only partially fills its niche in the invaded range. Predictions of non-native bird distribution in Europe were generated using several distribution modelling techniques. Results Niche overlap between native and non-native bird populations is low, but niche changes are smaller for species having a higher propagule pressure and that were introduced longer ago. Non-native birds in Europe occupy a subset of the environments they inhabit in their native ranges. Niche expansion into novel environments is rare for most species, allowing species distribution models to accurately predict invasion risk. Main conclusions Because of the recent nature of most bird introductions, species occupy only part of the suitable environments available in the invaded range. This signals that apart from purely ecological factors, patterns of niche conservatism may also be contingent on population-specific historical factors.

Aim - Concerns over how global change will influence species distributions, in conjunction with increased emphasis on understanding niche dynamics in evolutionary and community contexts, highlight the growing need for robust methods to quantify niche differences between or within taxa. We propose a statistical framework to describe and compare environmental niches from occurrence and spatial environmental data.|2. Location - Europe, North America, South America|3. Methods - The framework applies kernel smoothers to densities of species occurrence in gridded environmental space to calculate metrics of niche overlap and test hypotheses regarding niche conservatism. We use this framework and simulated species with predefined distributions and amounts of niche overlap to evaluate several ordination and species distribution modeling techniques for quantifying niche overlap. We illustrate the approach with data on two well-studied invasive species.|4. Results - We show that niche overlap can be accurately detected with the framework when variables driving the distributions are known. The method is robust to known and previously undocumented biases related to the dependence of species occurrences on the frequency of environmental conditions that occur across geographic space. The use of a kernel smoother makes the process of moving from geographical space to multivariate environmental space independent of both sampling effort and arbitrary choice of resolution in environmental space. However, the use of ordination and species distribution model techniques for selecting, combining and weighting variables on which niche overlap is calculated provide contrasting results.|5. Main conclusions - The framework meets the increasing need for robust methods to quantify niche differences. It is appropriate to study niche differences between species, subspecies or intraspecific lineages that differ in their geographical distributions.

Phases of this process, however, are emerging as highly predictable: the potential geographic course of an invasion can be anticipated with high precision based on the ecological niche characteristics of a species in its native geographic distributional area. This predictivity depends on the premise that ecological niches constitute long-term stable constraints on the potential geographic distributions of species, for which a sizeable body of evidence is accumulating.

Using an unusually large number of both failed and successful documented introductions of parakeets (Aves: Psittacidae) in Europe, we test two of the major hypotheses on the establishment success of invading species, namely the climate-matching and the human-activity hypothesis. Location European human population centres where ring-necked parakeet (Psittacula krameri) and/or monk parakeet (Myiopsitta monachus) introductions have occurred. Methods Data on ring-necked and monk parakeet introductions in Europe were gathered from various sources, including published books and articles, but also from unpublished reports and local grey literature. Information was verified with experts from the region under consideration. In order to test the climate-matching hypothesis, we verified whether the climatic factors that determine the parakeetsÕ native ranges also explain establishment success in Europe. Parakeet occurrence data from the native ranges were analysed using the presence-only modelling method Maxent, and correlations between parakeet establishment and climatic and anthropogenic variables in Europe were assessed using both stepwise logistic regression and the information-theoretic model selection approach. Results The establishment success of ring-necked and monk parakeets was found to be positively associated with human population density, and, both in the native and in the introduced regions, parakeet occurrence was negatively correlated with the number of frost days. Thus, parakeets are more likely to establish in warmer and human-dominated areas. Main conclusions The large number of independent parakeet introductions in Europe allows us to test the often-used climate-matching and human-activity hypotheses at the species level. We show that both hypotheses offer insight into the invasion process of monk and ring-necked parakeets. Our results suggest that, in the future, parakeet establishment probability may increase even further because global warming is likely to cause a decrease in the number of frost days and because urbanization and human populations are still increasing."

Using an experimental approach, we tested the behavioral responses of native garden birds in response to the presence of a rose-ringed parakeet versus the presence of a similarly sized and dominant native bird, the great spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopos major). Parakeet presence significantly reduced feeding rates and increased vigilance among native birds compared with our control treatments. Of visits made by native birds in the presence of a parakeet, feeding was more likely to occur in sites within the parakeet range compared with sites outside, suggesting some habituation of native birds has occurred following prior exposure to parakeets but overall foraging behavior is still disrupted.

"[""Richard G. Pearson"", ""Terence P.

A number of recent critiques have questioned the validity of this approach by pointing to the many factors other than climate that play an important part in determining species distributions and the dynamics of distribution changes. Such factors include biotic interactions, evolutionary change and dispersal ability. This paper reviews and evaluates criticisms of bioclimate envelope models and discusses the implications of these criticisms for the different modelling strategies employed. It is proposed that, although the complexity of the natural system presents fundamental limits to predictive modelling, the bioclimate envelope approach can provide a useful first approximation as to the potentially dramatic impact of climate change on biodiversity.

"[""Albert B Phillimore"", ""Ian P.F Owens""]"	"The taxonomic rank of subspecies remains highly contentious, largely because traditional subspecies boundaries have sometimes been contradicted by molecular phylogenetic data. The most complete meta-analysis to date, for instance, found that only 3% of traditional avian subspecies represented distinct phylogenetic lineages. However, the global generality of this phenomenon remains unclear due to this previous study's narrow geographic focus on continental Nearctic and Palearctic subspecies. Here, we present a new global analysis of avian subspecies and show that 36% of avian subspecies are, in fact, phylogenetically distinct. Among biogeographic realms we find significant differences in the proportion of subspecies that are phylogenetically distinct, with Nearctic/Palearctic subspecies showing significantly reduced levels of differentiation. Additionally, there are differences between island and continental subspecies, with continental subspecies significantly less likely to be genetically distinct. These results indicate that the overall level of congruence between taxonomic subspecies and molecular phylogenetic data is greater than previously thought. We suggest that the widespread impression that avian subspecies are not real arises from a predominance of studies focusing on continental subspecies in North America and Eurasia, regions which show unusually low levels of genetic differentiation. The broader picture is that avian subspecies often provide an effective short-cut for estimating patterns of intraspecific genetic diversity, thereby providing a useful tool for the study of evolutionary divergence and conservation."

P. Porter"", ""M. Kearney""]"	"A key challenge in ecology is to define species' niches on the basis of functional traits. Size and shape are important determinants of a species' niche but their causal role is often difficult to interpret. For endotherms, size and shape define the thermal niche through their interaction with core temperature, insulation, and environmental conditions, determining the thermoneutral zone (TNZ) where energy and water costs are minimized. Laboratory measures of metabolic rate used to describe TNZs cannot be generalized to infer the capacity for terrestrial animals to find their TNZ in complex natural environments. Here, we derive an analytical model of the thermal niche of an ellipsoid furred endotherm that accurately predicts field and laboratory data. We use the model to illustrate the relative importance of size and shape on the location of the TNZ under different environmental conditions. The interaction between body shape and posture strongly influences the location of the TNZ and the expected scaling of metabolic rate with size at constant temperature. We demonstrate that the latter relationship has a slope of approximately (1/2) rather than the commonly expected surface area/volume scaling of (2/3). We show how such functional traits models can be integrated with spatial environmental datasets to calculate null expectations for body size clines from a thermal perspective, aiding mechanistic interpretation of empirical clines such as Bergmann's Rule.

Application of these concepts in such artificial ecosystems may yield important insights for the management of natural ecosystems.

We are entreated to be fruitful and multiply, to fill the earth, and subdue it (Gen. 1:28). The bad news, and the good news, is that we have almost succeeded. There is little debate in scientific circles about the importance of human influence on ecosystems. According to scientists' reports, we appropriate over 40% of the net primary productivity (the green material) produced on Earth each year (Vitousek et al. 1986, Rojstaczer et al. 2001). We consume 35% of the productivity of the oceanic shelf (Pauly and Christensen 1995), and we use 60% of freshwater run-off (Postel et al. 1996). The unprecedented escalation in both human population and consumption in the 20th century has resulted in environmental crises never before encountered in the history of humankind and the world (McNeill 2000). E. O. Wilson (2002) claims it would now take four Earths to meet the consumption demands of the current human population, if every human consumed at the level of the average US inhabitant. The influence of human beings on the planet has become so pervasive that it is hard to find adults in any country who have not seen the environment around them reduced in natural values during their lifetimes--woodlots converted to agriculture, agricultural lands converted to suburban development, suburban development converted to urban areas. The cumulative effect of these many local changes is the global phenomenon of human influence on nature, a new geological epoch some call the ""anthropocene"" (Steffen and Tyson 2001). Human influence is arguably the most important factor affecting life of all kinds in today's world (Lande 1998, Terborgh 1999, Pimm 2001, UNEP 2001). Yet despite the broad consensus among biologists about the importance of human influence on nature, this phenomenon and its implications are not fully appreciated by the larger human community, which does not recognize them in its economic systems (Hall et al. 2001) or in most of its political decisions (Soule and Terborgh 1999, Chapin et al. 2000). In part, this lack of appreciation may be due to scientists' propensity to express themselves in terms like ""appropriation of net primary productivity"" or ""exponential population growth,"" abstractions that require some training to understand. It may be due to historical assumptions about and habits inherited from times when human beings, as a group, had dramatically less influence on the biosphere.

Understanding how biotic and environmental factors facilitate their invasion success remains a challenge. Here, we assess the role of two major hypotheses explaining invasion success: (1) enemy-release, which argues that invasive species are freed from their native predators and parasites in the new areas; and (2) climate-matching, which argues that the climatic similarity between the exotic and native range determines the success of invasive populations. Location India, Israel and the UK. Methods We studied the reproductive success of one of the most successful avian invaders, the rose-ringed parakeet ( Psittacula krameri ), in its native range (India) and in two introduced regions, varying in their climate conditions (Israel and the UK). We combined literature and field data to evaluate the role of predation pressure and climatic conditions in explaining the differences in reproductive success between the three regions. Results We found significant differences in reproductive success between regions. In accordance with the enemy-release hypothesis, we discovered that while predation was the main factor responsible for the reduction of fecundity in India, it did not significantly affect the fecundities of parakeet populations in the two introduced regions. In accordance with the climate-matching hypothesis, we found that in the colder temperate UK, egg infertility was high, resulting in lower fecundities. Populations in both the warmer Mediterranean climate of Israel and in the native Indian range had significantly lower egg infertility and higher fecundities than the UK populations."

In view of this, management efforts should concentrate on invasives that have detrimental effects on native biota. However, action against invasives is often hindered by a lack of relevant ecological information such as the expected distribution and impact of the invader. Our aims were to identify the habitat characteristics that influence ring-necked parakeet abundance in Belgium and to assess the effects of competition for nesting cavities with native hole-nesters. We determined the abundance of parakeets and native hole-nesters in 44 study sites using point counts. We examined the relationship between parakeet numbers and a set of habitat and landscape variables and to assess the effect of competition, we studied the relationships between the number of parakeets and the number of native hole-nesters. We found that parakeet abundance differs between vegetation types based on dominant tree species, and that abundance is higher in forests or parks surrounded by built-up areas. Parakeet numbers were also strongly associated with cavity density, suggesting that this may be a limiting factor. Of the two native hole-nesters considered to be the most vulnerable to competition (nuthatch and starling), we found a negative association with parakeet numbers for the nuthatch only.

In this study, we adopt a replicated beforeÐafter-control experimental design to test for competition between parakeets and native cavity-nesters. In experimental plots in Brussels, Belgium we blocked parakeet nesting cavities and conducted surveys to evaluate availability and use of cavities by parakeets and native hole-nesters. Numbers of breeding pairs, as well as cavity quality index Ð based on cavity occupancy rates Ð were evaluated before and after blocking. After blocking, numbers of native nuthatches (Sitta europaea) declined significantly, largely due to nest take-overs by parakeets. Nuthatches and parakeets strongly overlap in preferred nest-sites and this overlap explains the competition that leads to a reduction in nuthatch numbers when suitable cavities become scarce. Average quality of parakeet nests was lower after blocking, indicating that parakeets will utilize alternative cavities when preferred sites are not available, bringing them into greater conflict with other cavity nesters.

Niche changes between native and non-native populations are increasingly reported. However, it has been argued that these changes arise mainly because in their novel range, species occupy only a subset of the environments they inhabit in their native range, and not because they expand into environments entirely novel to them. Here, using occurrences of 29 vertebrate species native to either Europe or North America and introduced into the other continent, we assess the prevalence of niche changes between native and non-native populations and assess whether the changes detected are caused primarily by native niche unfi lling in the non-native range rather than by expansion into novel environments. We show that niche overlap between native and non-native populations is generally low because of a large degree of niche unfi lling in the non-native range. This most probably refl ects an ongoing colonization of the novel range, as niche changes were smaller for species that were introduced longer ago and into a larger number of locations. Niche expansion was rare, and for the few species exhibiting larger amounts of niche overlap, an unfi lling of the niche in the native range (e.g. through competition or dispersal limitations) is the most probable explanation. Th e fact that for most species, the realized non-native niche is a subset of the realized native niche allows native-range based niche models to generate accurate predictions of invasion risk. Th ese results suggest that niche changes arising during biological invasions are strongly infl uenced by propagule pressure and colonization processes, and we argue that introduction history should be taken into account when evaluating niche conservatism in the context of biological invasions."

Whitney"", ""Christopher A. Gabler""]"	"The damaging effects of invasive organisms have triggered the development of Invasive Species Predictive Schemes (ISPS). These schemes evaluate biological and historical characteristics of species and prioritize those that should be the focus of exclusion, quarantine, and/or control. However, it is not clear how commonly these schemes take microevolutionary considerations into account. We review the recent literature and find that rapid evolutionary changes are common during invasions. These evolutionary changes include rapid adaptation of invaders to new environments, effects of hybridization, and evolution in recipient communities. Strikingly, we document 38 species in which the specific traits commonly associated with invasive potential (e.g. growth rate, dispersal ability, generation time) have themselves undergone evolutionary change following introduction, in some cases over very short ( <= 10 year) timescales. In contrast, our review of 29 ISPS spanning plant, animal, and microbial taxa shows that the majority (76%) envision invading species and recipient communities as static entities. Those that incorporate evolutionary considerations do so in a limited way. Evolutionary change not only affects the predictive power of these schemes, but also complicates their evaluation. We argue that including the evolutionary potential of species and communities in ISPS is overdue, present several metrics related to evolutionary potential that could be incorporated in ISPS, and provide suggestions for further research on these metrics and their performance. Finally, we argue that the fact of evolutionary change during invasions begs for added caution during risk assessment."

An information-theoretic approach based on simulated data	"[""Mary S Wisz"", ""Antoine Guisan""]"	"Multiple logistic regression is precluded from many practical applications in ecology that aim to predict the geographic distributions of species because it requires absence data, which are rarely available or are unreliable. In order to use multiple logistic regression, many studies have simulated ""pseudo-absences"" through a number of strategies, but it is unknown how the choice of strategy influences models and their geographic predictions of species. In this paper we evaluate the effect of several prevailing pseudo-absence strategies on the predictions of the geographic distribution of a virtual species whose ""true"" distribution and relationship to three environmental predictors was predefined. We evaluated the effect of using a) real absences b) pseudo-absences selected randomly from the background and c) two-step approaches: pseudo-absences selected from low suitability areas predicted by either Ecological Niche Factor Analysis: (ENFA) or BIOCLIM. We compared how the choice of pseudo-absence strategy affected model fit, predictive power, and information-theoretic model selection results.Models built with true absences had the best predictive power, best discriminatory power, and the ""true"" model (the one that contained the correct predictors) was supported by the data according to AIC, as expected. Models based on random pseudo-absences had among the lowest fit, but yielded the second highest AUC value (0.97), and the ""true"" model was also supported by the data. Models based on two-step approaches had intermediate fit, the lowest predictive power, and the ""true"" model was not supported by the data.If ecologists wish to build parsimonious GLM models that will allow them to make robust predictions, a reasonable approach is to use a large number of randomly selected pseudo-absences, and perform model selection based on an information theoretic approach.

Biotic interactions and their dynamics influence species' relationships to climate, and this also has important implications for predicting future distributions of species. It is already well accepted that biotic interactions shape species' spatial distributions at local spatial extents, but the role of these interactions beyond local extents (e.g. 10 km(2)  to global extents) are usually dismissed as unimportant. In this review we consolidate evidence for how biotic interactions shape species distributions beyond local extents and review methods for integrating biotic interactions into species distribution modelling tools. Drawing upon evidence from contemporary and palaeoecological studies of individual species ranges, functional groups, and species richness patterns, we show that biotic interactions have clearly left their mark on species distributions and realised assemblages of species across all spatial extents. We demonstrate this with examples from within and across trophic groups. A range of species distribution modelling tools is available to quantify species environmental relationships and predict species occurrence, such as: (i) integrating pairwise dependencies, (ii) using integrative predictors, and (iii) hybridising species distribution models (SDMs) with dynamic models. These methods have typically only been applied to interacting pairs of species at a single time, require a priori ecological knowledge about which species interact, and due to data paucity must assume that biotic interactions are constant in space and time. To better inform the future development of these models across spatial scales, we call for accelerated collection of spatially and temporally explicit species data. Ideally, these data should be sampled to reflect variation in the underlying environment across large spatial extents, and at fine spatial resolution. Simplified ecosystems where there are relatively few interacting species and sometimes a wealth of existing ecosystem monitoring data (e.g. arctic, alpine or island habitats) offer settings where the development of modelling tools that account for biotic interactions may be less difficult than elsewhere.(c) 2012 The Authors.

We analysed the feeding habits of Rose-ringed parakeets near Paris, France, in order to assess if food provided by humans might contribute to the success of this invasive bird species. We considered 87 feeding events performed during 2002 - 2007 and 247 feeding events performed during March - November 2008.

Bradshaw"", ""Christina M. Holzapfel""]"	"Climate change is rapidly advancing spring phenology [1, 2, 3] but at different rates in different species [1, 4]. Whether these advances are solely driven by phenotypic plasticity [2, 5] or also involve evolution is hotly debated (e.g., [5, 6, 7]). In some species, including avian long-distance migrants, plastic responses to early springs may be constrained by inherited circannual timing programs [8, 9], making evolutionary adjustment the only viable mechanism for keeping pace with shifting phenology [5, 10]. This constraint may be contributing to population declines in migratory species [5, 10, 11, 12]. To test whether a migrant's timing program has evolved [10, 12], we replicated an experimental study of the annual cycle of long-distance migratory pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) after 21 years of warming. Flycatchers are a model for studying constrained ecological responses to climate change [6, 10, 12, 13]. We show that the phase of the flycatcher circannual clock controlling spring moult, migration, and reproductive timing advanced by 9 days. A nearby wild population mirrored these changes, concurrently advancing egg-laying by 11 days. Furthermore, the time window during which wild flycatcher reproductive timing was most sensitive to ambient temperature advanced by 0.8 days year-1. These results support a role of phenotypic evolution [14] in changing spring phenology [15, 16]. We suggest that the timing programs of long-distance migratory birds may have greater adaptive potential than previously thought, leaving some scope for evolutionary rescue in a changing climate"	"Such traits may be genetically based and therefore likely to respond to selection (#AUTHOR_TAG & Holzapfel, 2006) in the parakeet's invasive range."

Focusing on the ring-necked parakeet (Psittacula krameri), one of the most invasive birds worldwide, we combined observations of interspecific aggressions, species-specific cavity-nest preferences and the spatial distribution of the native cavity-nesting vertebrate community to determine the invasion process as well as its potential impacts on native species in a Mediterranean city. Our results support the competition hypothesis, suggesting that ring-necked parakeets are outcompeting native species sharing nest-site preferences. Parakeets initiated and won most interspecific aggressions, which were directed towards competitors but also towards predators. This behaviour could explain the spatial arrangement of natives, with most bird species breeding close to parakeets possibly to take advantage of their effective antipredatory behaviour. However, temporal and spatial patterns of segregation suggest that a threatened bat species is negatively affected by parakeets. This demonstrates that common species gain benefits and threatened ones (in this study, a bat and possibly a falcon) lose nest sites due to invaders. Therefore, the conservation status of the native species that pay the costs of competition with invaders should be considered. This scenario of winners and losers may, however, shift towards more losers if the ring-necked parakeet population continues to grow, thus requiring close monitoring and control/eradication programs to avoid further impacts."

Hijmans"", ""Susan E. Cameron"", ""Juan L. Parra"", ""Peter G. Jones"", ""Andy Jarvis""]"	"We developed interpolated climate surfaces for global land areas (excluding Antarctica) at a spatial resolution of 30 arc s (often referred to as 1-km spatial resolution). The climate elements considered were monthly precipitation and mean, minimum, and maximum temperature. Input data were gathered from a variety of sources and, where possible, were restricted to records from the 1950-2000 period. We used the thin-plate smoothing spline algorithm implemented in the ANUSPLIN package for interpolation, using latitude, longitude, and elevation as independent variables. We quantified uncertainty arising from the input data and the interpolation by mapping weather station density, elevation bias in the weather stations, and elevation variation within grid cells and through data partitioning and cross validation. Elevation bias tended to be negative (stations lower than expected) at high latitudes but positive in the tropics. Uncertainty is highest in mountainous and in poorly sampled areas. Data partitioning showed high uncertainty of the surfaces on isolated islands, e.g. in the Pacific. Aggregating the elevation and climate data to 10 arc min resolution showed an enormous variation within grid cells, illustrating the value of high-resolution surfaces. A comparison with an existing data set at 10 arc min resolution showed overall agreement, but with significant variation in some regions. A comparison with two high-resolution data sets for the United States also identified areas with large local differences, particularly in mountainous areas. Compared to previous global climatologies, ours has the following advantages: the data are at a higher spatial resolution (400 times greater or more); more weather station records were used; improved elevation data were used; and more information about spatial patterns of uncertainty in the data is available. Owing to the overall low density of available climate stations, our surfaces do not capture of all variation that may occur at a resolution of 1 km, particularly of precipitation in mountainous areas. In future work, such variation might be captured through knowledge-based methods and inclusion of additional co-variates, particularly layers obtained through remote sensing.

As many available datasets (e.g. museums, herbariums, atlas) do not provide reliable information about species absences, several presence-only based analyses have been developed. However, methods to evaluate the accuracy of their predictions are few and have never been validated. The aim of this paper is to compare existing and new presenceonly evaluators to usual presence/absence measures. We use a reliable, diverse, presence/absence dataset of 114 plant species to test how common presence/absence indices (Kappa, MaxKappa, AUC, adjusted D-2) compare to presenceonly measures (AVI, CVI, Boyce index) for evaluating generalised linear models (GLM). Moreover we propose a new, threshold-independent evaluator, which we call ""continuous Boyce index"". All indices were implemented in the B10MAPPER software. We show that the presence-only evaluators are fairly correlated (p &gt; 0.7) to the presence/absence ones. The Boyce indices are closer to AUC than to MaxKappa and are fairly insensitive to species prevalence. In addition, the Boyce indices provide predicted-toexpected ratio curves that offer further insights into the model quality: robustness, habitat suitability resolution and deviation from randomness. This information helps reclassifying predicted maps into meaningful habitat suitability classes.

Adaptations relevant to invasions are typically thought to occur either recently within the introduced range, as an evolutionary response to novel selection regimes, or within the native range, because of long-term adaptation to the local environment. We propose that recent adaptation within the native range, in particular adaptations to human-altered habitat, could also contribute to the evolution of invasive populations. Populations adapted to human-altered habitats in the native range are likely to increase in abundance within areas frequented by humans and associated with human transport mechanisms, thus enhancing the likelihood of transport to a novel range. Given that habitats are altered by humans in similar ways worldwide, as evidenced by global environmental homogenization, propagules from populations adapted to human-altered habitats in the native range should perform well within similarly human-altered habitats in the novel range. We label this scenario 'Anthropogenically Induced Adaptation to Invade'. We illustrate how it differs from other evolutionary processes that may occur during invasions, and how it can help explain accelerating rates of invasions."

JESCHKE"", ""DAVID L. STRAYER""]"	"Species that are frequently introduced to an exotic range have a high potential of becoming invasive. Besides propagule pressure, however, no other generally strong determinant of invasion success is known. Although evidence has accumulated that human affiliates (domesticates, pets, human commensals) also have high invasion success, existing studies do not distinguish whether this success can be completely explained by or is partly independent of propagule pressure. Here, we analyze both factors independently, propagule pressure and human affiliation. We also consider a third factor directly related to humans, hunting, and 17 traits on each species' population size and extent, diet, body size, and life history. Our dataset includes all 2362 freshwater fish, mammals, and birds native to Europe or North America. In contrast to most previous studies, we look at the complete invasion process consisting of (1) introduction, (2) establishment, and (3) spread. In this way, we not only consider which of the introduced species became invasive but also which species were introduced. Of the 20 factors tested, propagule pressure and human affiliation were the two strongest determinants of invasion success across all taxa and steps. This was true for multivariate analyses that account for intercorrelations among variables as well as univariate analyses, suggesting that human affiliation influenced invasion success independently of propagule pressure. Some factors affected the different steps of the invasion process antagonistically. For example, game species were much more likely to be introduced to an exotic continent than nonhunted species but tended to be less likely to establish themselves and spread. Such antagonistic effects show the importance of considering the complete invasion process."

Niche conservatism predicts a pattern where sister taxa will occupy similar niche spaces; whereas niche divergence predicts that sister taxa will occupy diff erent niche spaces. Widely distributed species often show distinct phylogeographic structure, but little research has been conducted on how the environment may be related to these phylogenetic patterns. We investigated the relationship between lineage divergence and environmental space for the closely related species Peromyscus maniculatus and P. polionotus utilizing phylogenetic techniques and ecological niche modeling (ENM). We estimated the phylogenetic relationship among individuals based on complete cytochrome b sequences that represent individuals from a majority of the species ranges. Niche spaces that lineages occupy were estimated by using 12 environmental layers. Diff erences in niche space were tested using multivariate statistics based on location data, and ENMs were employed using maximum entropy algorithms. Two similarity indices estimated signifi cant divergence in environmental space based on the ENM. Six geographically structured lineages were identifi ed within P. maniculatus. Nested within P. maniculatus we found that P. polionotus recently diverged from a clade occupying central and western United States. We estimated that the majority of the genetic lineages occupy distinct environmental niches, which supports a pattern of niche divergence. Two sister taxa showed niche divergence and represent diff erent ecomorphs, suggesting morphological, genetic and ecological divergence between the two lineages. Two other sister taxa were observed in the same environmental space based on multivariate statistics, suggesting niche conservatism.

Here, we argue for the importance of mechanistically modelling niches based on functional traits of organisms and explore the possibilities for achieving this through the integration of three theoretical frameworks: biophysical ecology (BE), the geometric framework for nutrition (GF) and dynamic energy budget (DEB) models. These three frameworks are fundamentally based on the conservation laws of thermodynamics, describing energy and mass balance at the level of the individual and capturing the prodigious predictive power of the concepts of 'homeostasis' and 'evolutionary fitness'. BE and the GF provide mechanistic multi-dimensional depictions of climatic and nutritional niches, respectively, providing a foundation for linking organismal traits (morphology, physiology, behaviour) with habitat characteristics. In turn, they provide driving inputs and cost functions for mass/energy allocation within the individual as determined by DEB models.

Depending on mass, we are sensitive to coalescences as far as 150 Mpc from the Earth. No gravitational wave signals were observed above the expected background. Assuming a compact binary objects population with a Gaussian mass distribution representing binary neutron star systems, black hole-neutron star binary systems, and binary black hole systems, we calculate the 90%-confidence upper limit on the rate of coalescences to be 3.9 \times 10^{-2} yr^{-1} L_{10}^{-1}, 1.1 \times 10^{-2} yr^{-1} L_{10}^{-1}, and 2.5 \times 10^{-3} yr^{-1} L_{10}^{-1} respectively, where L10 is 1010 times the blue solar luminosity.

CCT496	2073440	Triangulation of gravitational wave sources with a network of detectors	Stephen Fairhurst	Coherent algorithm for reconstructing the location of a coalescing binary using a system of three gravitational wave interferometers Ph	"["" Birindelli""]"	"The Virgo project is one of the ground based interferometers on the earth surface that aim to detect gravitational waves. This thesis work concerns the data analysis for the coalescing binaries stars, that are among the most promising gravitational waves sources, since the shape of their signal is well known. The gravitational waves emission from a binary system of compact stars acts like a sort of feedback: the system radiates loosing its orbital energy, so the orbit shrinks and the emission becomes stronger. The signal is therefore called a chirp, due to this characteristic amplitude and frequency increasing with time. The expectation rate for the double neutron stars merging is 3.4 á 10_5 per year. Translated in detection expectation rate this corresponds to a detected event every 125 years for the LIGO detectors, and one every 148 years for the Virgo one. For the advanced new generation of detectors, that will be working within the next years, the expectation rate with the 2004 proposed configuration of advanced detectors is definitely better: 6 events per year for the so called Enhanced LIGO, and 3 every two years for the Advanced Virgo (updated scenarios for detection rates, with a more recent Advanced Virgo configuration are under development). The technique that suites at best the analysis of this kind of signal is the matched filter, that consists in computing the correlation between the data stream (output of the gravitational waves interferometer) and a set of theoretical tem- plates. From this analysis, using a single detector, it is possible to determine the masses of the two stars, and the so called optimal orientation distance, that is the source distance provided that the orbit has the best inclination with respect to the interferometer line of sight. Reconstructing the source position, so as to draw a gravitational waves sources sky map, requires at least three non-coincident detectors, in order to make a triangula- tion. Another very good reason to use a network of gravitational waves interferometers is that the detection rate can be improved considering a network of three detectors (Virgo, Hanford and Livingston) and operating a coherent analysis, since in this case the expected rate corresponds to one event each 26 years. There are two different methods used for the network analysis: the coincident method, and the coherent one. The first is the most intuitive one, and simply consists in a separate single detec- tor analysis performed by each interferometer, and a successive comparison between the single detector candidates, searching for compatible events. After that process, only the coincidences remain as candidate events, and they can be used for the source position reconstruction, using the time delays between detectors. The basic idea of the coherent method is to construct an ideal detector equivalent to the network, to which each real interferometer coherently contributes with its sensitivity, location, orientation. For this purpose a so called network statistic to maximize in order to extrapolate the source pa- rameters is constructed, first, and maximized then. For this thesis we have worked on coalescing binaries network analysis, trying to determine the best strategy for source position reconstruction. We have developed a pipeline that implements a fully coherent method, in a few different variations, and we have compared them with the classical time- of-light coincidence analysis. The coincident method has been optimized in order to make a fair comparison; in particular we have adopted the reference time, for implementing the coincidence, and we have further improved the arrival time accuracy by fitting the shape of the matched filter response. Among the coherent techniques tested, the sim- plest has been a direct maximization of the network likelihood. A fit of the likelihood to improve the determination of the likelihood maximum has also been attempted but the fitting procedure resulted unstable; instead, we have found most effective to define the most likely declination and right ascension by means of an average procedure weighted by the corresponding network likelihood. This procedure allows to remove the discretization effect due to the finite sampling rate of the analysis, and provides results compatible with the ones obtained with the time-of-light technique, and in a relatively automatic way. The study of the accuracy problem, comparing the two methods of analysis gives in a certain way two important consequences: first of all the determination of the best coherent strategy for reconstructing the source position among all the alternatives, both in terms of efficiency, and in term of computational costs; and as a secondary effect it gives us the incipit for push the coincident method to its best, provided that one uses all the correlators information. If we give a glance to the future, since new interferometric gravitational waves detectors are under construction and under project, another important feature of the coherent method is its exibility to be adapted to a larger number of detectors. The coherent method can tell us how to combine them in order to obtain with the best accuracy the source position, instead of analyzing all the possible independent triangulations, and loosing in that way part of the event astrophysical information."

Intergroup differences were assessed by ANOVA and age relationships by correlation analyses.Sprint cyclists had the largest bone shafts and bone strength surrogates; the difference in diaphyseal BMC, area, and RPol compared with controls being >or=10% in the tibia and >or=8% in the radius (P < 0.01). Distance cyclists versus control group differences were smaller (tibia: approximately 4-10%; radius: <2%), reaching statistical significance only for tibial BMC and area (P < 0.05). Generally, epiphyseal bone measures showed no group differences. In the radius, age correlations were negative for both the sprinters' and the controls' diaphyseal and the sprinters' epiphyseal BMD; they were positive for the controls' diaphyseal endocortical and periosteal circumferences (P < 0.05). In the cyclists' tibiae, neither epiphyseal nor diaphyseal bone measures were correlated with age.Sprint cyclists and to a lesser extent distance cyclists had greater tibia and radius bone strength surrogates than the controls, with tibial bone measures being well preserved with age in all groups. This suggests that competition-based cycling and the associated training regime is beneficial in preserving average or above-average bone strength surrogates into old age in men."

Empirical studies have demonstrated that organisms adapted to fluctuating energy availability plastically adjust their storage strategies. So far, however, theoretical studies have investigated general storage strategies only in constant or deterministically varying environments. In this study, we analyze how the ability to store energy influences optimal energy allocation to storage, reproduction, and maintenance in environments in which energy availability varies stochastically. We find that allocation to storage is evolutionarily optimal when environmental energy availability is intermediate and energy stores are not yet too full. In environments with low variability and low predictability of energy availability, it is not optimal to store energy. As environments become more variable or more predictable, energy allocation to storage is increasingly favoured. By varying environmental variability, environmental predictability, and the cost of survival, we obtain a variety of different optimal life-history strategies, from highly iteroparous to semelparous, which differ significantly in their storage patterns. Our results demonstrate that in a stochastically varying environment simultaneous allocation to reproduction, maintenance, and storage can be optimal, which contrasts with previous findings obtained for deterministic environments"	"The role of depots, as determined by a general principle in economic supply chains, is energy buffering in unstable environments (#AUTHOR_TAG et al., 2011)."

Schweiger"", ""L. Pellerin"", ""C. Hubold"", ""K.M. Oltmanns"", ""M. Conrad"", ""B. Schultes"", ""J. Born"", ""H.L. Fehm""]"	"The brain occupies a special hierarchical position in the organism. It is separated from the general circulation by the blood-brain barrier, has high energy consumption and a low energy storage capacity, uses only specific substrates, and it can record information from the peripheral organs and control them. Here we present a new paradigm for the regulation of energy supply within the organism. The brain gives priority to regulating its own adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentration. In that postulate, the peripheral energy supply is only of secondary importance. The brain has two possibilities to ensure its energy supply: allocation or intake of nutrients. The term 'allocation' refers to the allocation of energy resources between the brain and the periphery. Neocortex and the limbic-hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (LHPA) system control the allocation and intake. In order to keep the energy concentrations constant, the following mechanisms are available to the brain: (1) high and low-affinity ATP-sensitive potassium channels measure the ATP concentration in neurons of the neocortex and generate a 'glutamate command' signal. This signal affects the brain ATP concentration by locally (via astrocytes) stimulating glucose uptake across the blood-brain barrier and by systemically (via the LHPA system) inhibiting glucose uptake into the muscular and adipose tissue. (2) High-affinity mineralocorticoid and low-affinity glucocorticoid receptors determine the state of balance, i.e. the setpoint, of the LHPA system. This setpoint can permanently and pathologically be displaced by extreme stress situations (chronic metabolic and psychological stress, traumatization, etc.), by starvation, exercise, infectious diseases, hormones, drugs, substances of abuse, or chemicals disrupting the endocrine system. Disorders in the 'energy on demand' process or the LHPA-system can influence the allocation of energy and in so doing alter the body mass of the organism. In summary, the presented model includes a newly discovered 'principle of balance' of how pairs of high and low-affinity receptors can originate setpoints in biological systems.

As opposed to 'homeostatic feeding', where food intake is restricted to satisfy one's biological needs, the term 'non-homeostatic' feeding refers to eating for pleasure or the trend to over-consume (palatable) food. Overconsumption is considered a crucial factor in the development of obesity. Exaggerated consumption of (palatable) food, coupled to a loss of control over food intake despite awareness of its negative consequences, suggests that overeating may be a form of addiction. At a molecular level, insulin and leptin resistance are hallmarks of obesity. In this review, we specifically address the question how leptin resistance contributes to enhanced craving for (palatable) food. Since dopamine is a key player in the motivation for food, the interconnection between dopamine, leptin and neuropeptides related to feeding will be discussed. Understanding the mechanisms by which these neuropeptidergic systems hijack the homeostatic feeding mechanisms, thus leading to overeating and obesity is the primary aim of this review. The melanocortin system, one of the crucial neuropeptidergic systems modulating feeding behavior will be extensively discussed. The inter-relationship between neuronal populations in the arcuate nucleus and other areas regulating energy homeostasis (lateral hypothalamus, paraventricular nucleus, ventromedial hypothalamus etc.) and reward circuitry (the ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens) will be evaluated and scrutinized.Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Huge amounts of research money are currently being invested in seeking the underlying cause, with corresponding progress in understanding the disease progression. In this paper, we highlight how an excess of dietary carbohydrates, particularly fructose, alongside a relative deficiency in dietary fats and cholesterol, may lead to the development of Alzheimer's disease. A first step in the pathophysiology of the disease is represented by advanced glycation end-products in crucial plasma proteins concerned with fat, cholesterol, and oxygen transport. This leads to cholesterol deficiency in neurons, which significantly impairs their ability to function. Over time, a cascade response leads to impaired glutamate signaling, increased oxidative damage, mitochondrial and lysosomal dysfunction, increased risk to microbial infection, and, ultimately, apoptosis.

Considerable variation in food intake is brought about in response to change in heat loss to the environment, or in loss of food through the mammary gland in lactation, without appreciable change of weight. Hypothalamic damage permits excessive intake and causes obesity. The degree of obesity and in general its rate of development, is a function of the degree of dam age to the region of the tuber cinereum , and is independent of changes of intake with environmental temperature. It is suggested that the hypothalamic satiety mechanism is concerned only in the prevention of an overall surplus of energy intake over expenditure, which would cause the deposition of fat in the depots. The simplest way in which this lipostasis could be achieved is b y sensitivity to the concentration of circulating metabolites. There is no disturbance of temperature regulation or acclimatization to changed environmental temperature in obese rats. These findings do not support the suggestion made by Brobeck (1946) that food intake is controlled as part of the normal regulation of body temperature by a thermosensitive hypothalamic centre. The maximum daily in take of food during hyperphagia appears to be determined by some limiting factor additional to the hypothalamic mechanism. A similar factor appears to operate in lactation. Reasons are advanced for regarding this as the limiting rate at which absorbed foodstuffs can be removed from the circulation, that is as some aspect of the synthesis or transport of fat."

When for any reason the daily oxidation of sugar in the body falls below a certain minimum (say 50 to 75 gm. per day for a man weighing 75 kilograms) then some degree of acidosis supervenes. In the acidosis of starvation, in which lowered sugar combustion is the result of a diminished intake of carbohydrate food, the mere administration of sugar serves to stop the accumulation of acetone bodies.

However, such products may interfere with a learned relationship between the sensory properties of food and the caloric consequences of consuming those foods. In the present experiment, we examined whether use of the fat substitute, olestra, affect energy balance by comparing the effects of consuming high-fat, high-calorie potato chips to the effects of consuming potato chips that sometimes signaled high calories (using high-fat potato chips) and that sometimes signaled lower calories (using nonfat potato chips manufactured with the fat substitute olestra). Food intake, body weight gain and adiposity were greater for rats that consumed both the high-calorie chips and the low-calorie chips with olestra compared to rats that consumed consuming only the high-calorie chips, but only if animals were also consuming a chow diet that was high in fat and calories. However, rats previously exposed to both the high- and low-calorie chips exhibited increased body weight gain, food intake and adiposity when they were subsequently provided with a high fat, high calorie chow diet suggesting that experience with the chips containing olestra affected the ability to predict high calories based on the sensory properties of fat.

It has become clear that the underlying mechanisms for the ergogenic effect during this type of activity are not metabolic but may reside in the central nervous system. Recent findings: Carbohydrate mouth rinses have been shown to result in similar performance improvements. This would suggest that the beneficial effects of carbohydrate feeding during exercise are not confined to its conventional metabolic advantage but may also serve as a positive afferent signal capable of modifying motor output. These effects are specific to carbohydrate and are independent of taste. The receptors in the oral cavity have not (yet) been identified and the exact role of various brain areas is not clearly understood. Further research is warranted to fully understand the separate taste transduction pathways for simple and complex carbohydrates and how these differ between mammalian species, particularly in humans.

Langley"", ""E.J. Bowers"", ""A.

The respiratory-induced variability of ECG features, P waves, QRS complexes, and T waves are described by the PCA. We assessed which ECG features and which principal components yielded the best surrogate for the respiratory signal. Twenty subjects performed controlled breathing for 180 s at 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 breaths per minute and normal breathing. ECG and breathing signals were recorded. Respiration was derived from the ECG by three algorithms: the PCA-based algorithm and two established algorithms, based on RR intervals and QRS amplitudes. ECG-derived respiration was compared to the recorded breathing signal by magnitude squared coherence and cross-correlation. The top ranking algorithm for both coherence and correlation was the PCA algorithm applied to QRS complexes. Coherence and correlation were significantly larger for this algorithm than the RR algorithm(p < 0.05 and p < 0.0001, respectively) but were not significantly different from the amplitude algorithm. PCA provides a novel algorithm for analysis of both respiratory and nonrespiratory related beat-to-beat changes in different ECG features."

Larsen"", ""D. C.

Using the proportional Shannon entropy (SH(alpha)) of the RI(-1) interval (interval between inspiration and the preceding ECG R wave) as a measure of coupling we detected statistically significant coupling in 32 of the 48 subjects. This was confirmed by visual inspection of time series plots of RI intervals, in which coupling was evident as horizontal banding. Coupling resulted in a significant preference for whole number heart rate/respiratory frequency ratios. The strongest coupling was associated with low ventilatory frequency and high heart rate variability in the high (0.15-0.40 Hz) and low (0.04-0.15 Hz) frequency ranges, but was not related to blood pressure variability, or to a spectral measure of baroreflex sensitivity (alpha-index, low frequency range). There was no difference in coupling strength between males and females. We have previously described cardioventilatory coupling in spontaneously breathing anaesthetised subjects. The current study extends those observations by demonstrating that the qualitative features of coupling seen during anaesthesia are also observed in the conscious state.

ROUTLEDGE"", ""Saqib CHOWDHARY"", ""John H. COOTE"", ""Jonathan N. TOWNEND""]"	"In healthy young subjects there is direct evidence for sympathetic vasoconstrictor activation after drinking water, but this is not accompanied by an increase in arterial blood pressure. A marked pressor response to water ingestion has, however, been observed in elderly subjects and in patients with autonomic failure. We examined the effect of water ingestion on haemodynamic variables and heart rate variability (HRV) markers of cardiac vagal control in ten healthy young subjects and four cardiac transplant recipients with confirmed persistent cardiac vagal denervation. In a random order crossover protocol, changes in heart rate, blood pressure and measures of high frequency (HF) HRV were compared over time following the ingestion of 500 ml and 20 ml (control) of tap water. In healthy subjects, after drinking 500 ml of water the heart rate fell from 67.6+/-2.0 (mean+/-S.E.M.) to 60.7+/-2.4 beats/min (P<0.01), and the bradycardic response peaked between 20 and 25 min. There were no significant changes in arterial blood pressure. Over the same time course, water ingestion caused increases in measurements of HF HRV: root-mean-square of successive RR interval differences (RMSSD) increased by 13+/-2.7 ms after 500 ml versus 2+/-3.1 ms after 20 ml (P<0.05); HF power increased by 686+/-400 versus -63+/-322 (P<0.01). In transplant recipients water ingestion was followed by a pressor response (range 13 to 29 mmHg). These results provide evidence that water ingestion in normal subjects is followed by an increase in cardiac vagal control that may counteract the pressor effects of sympathetic activation. We suggest that in the elderly, in transplant recipients and in autonomic failure, loss of this buffering mechanism explains the pressor response to drinking water."

Fifteen male athletes were subjected to HRV measurements under six randomised breathing conditions: spontaneous breathing frequency (SBF) and five others at controlled breathing frequencies (CBF) (0.20; 0.175; 0.15; 0.125 and 0.10 Hz). The subjects were divided in two groups: the first group included athletes with SBF <0.15 Hz (infSBF) and the second athletes with SBF higher than 0.15 Hz (supSBF). Fatigue and training load were evaluated using a validated questionnaire. There was no difference between the two groups for the fatigue questionnaire and training load. However, the LF/HF ratio during SBF was higher in infSBF than in supSBF (6.82 +- 4.55 vs. 0.72 +- 0.52; p<0.001). The SBF and LF/HF ratio were significantly correlated (R=-0.69; p=0.004). For the five CBF, no differences were found between groups; however, LF/HF ratios were very significantly different between sessions at 0.20; 0.175; 0.15 Hz and 0.125; 0.10 Hz. In this study, BF was the main modulator of the LF/HF ratio in both controlled breathing and spontaneous breathing. Although, none of the subjects of the infSBF group were overtrained, during SBF they all presented LF/HF ratios higher than four commonly interpreted as an overtraining syndrome. During each CBF, all athletes presented spectral energy mainly concentrated around their BF. Consequently, spectral energy was located either in LF or in HF band. These results demonstrate that the LF/HF ratio is unreliable for studying athletes presenting SBF close to 0.15 Hz leading to misclassification in fatigue."

Bruce""]"	"Breath-to-breath variations in the pattern of breathing can occur as uncorrelated random variations (Òwhite noiseÓ), correlated random changes, or as one of two types of nonrandom variations: periodic oscillations or nonrandom nonperiodic fluctuations. White noise is probably present in all physiological processes. In many cases, periodic variations are due to oscillations originating in chemoreflex feedback loops. It has long been hypothesized that correlated random variations in breathing pattern are due to central neutral Òmemory mechanisms, but part of this behavior might be due to chemoreflex mechanisms. Recently it has been concluded that nonlinear interactions between pulmonary and airway afferent activities and integrative central respiratory mechanisms can produce nonrandom nonperiodic (and also periodic) variability of the respiratory pattern. These latter studies have provided new insights about the behavioral relevance of the integrative character of central respiratory mechanisms and the time-varying nature of pulmonary afferent activities and have emphasized the importance of identifying the physiological bases for these phenomena. These and other findings are interpreted assuming that respiratory rhythm generation/pattern formation occurs via a nonlinear oscillator, and novel inferences concerning temporal variations of the breathing pattern are proposed."

A Polyvagal Theory	"[""STEPHEN W. PORGES""]"	"The vagus, the 10th cranial nerve, contains pathways that contribute to the regulation of the internal viscera, including the heart. Vagal efferent fibers do not originate in a common brainstem structure. The Polyvagal Theory is introduced to explain the different functions of the two primary medullary source nuclei of the vagus: the nucleus ambiguus (NA) and the dorsal motor nucleus (DMNX). Although vagal pathways from both nuclei terminate on the sinoatrial node, it is argued that the fibers originating in NA are uniquely responsible for respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). Divergent shifts in RSA and heart rate are explained by independent actions of DMNX and NA. The theory emphasizes a phylogenetic perspective and speculates that mammalian, but not reptilian, brainstem organization is characterized by a ventral vagal complex (including NA) related to processes associated with attention, motion, emotion, and communication. Various clinical disorders, such as sudden infant death syndrome and asthma, may be related to the competition between DMNX and NA."

Taylor""]"	"Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA, or high-frequency heart-rate variability) is frequently employed as an index of cardiac vagal tone or even believed to be a direct measure of vagal tone. However, there are many significant caveats regarding vagal tone interpretation: 1. Respiratory parameters can confound relations between RSA and cardiac vagal tone.2. Although intraindividual relations between RSA and cardiac vagal control are often strong, interindividual associations may be modest.3. RSA measurement is profoundly influenced by concurrent levels of momentary physical activity, which can bias estimation of individual differences in vagal tone.4. RSA magnitude is affected by beta-adrenergic tone.5. RSA and cardiac vagal tone can dissociate under certain circumstances.6. The polyvagal theory contains evolution-based speculations that relate RSA, vagal tone and behavioral phenomena. We present evidence that the polyvagal theory does not accurately depict evolution of vagal control of heart-rate variability, and that it ignores the phenomenon of cardiac aliasing and disregards the evolution of a functional role for vagal control of the heart, from cardiorespiratory synchrony in fish to RSA in mammals. Unawareness of these issues can lead to misinterpretation of cardiovascular autonomic mechanisms. On the other hand, RSA has been shown to often provide a reasonable reflection of cardiac vagal tone when the above-mentioned complexities are considered. Finally, a recent hypothesis is expanded upon, in which RSA plays a primary role in regulation of energy exchange by means of synchronizing respiratory and cardiovascular processes during metabolic and behavioral change."	"To wit, by controlling for breathing in HRV recordings the researcher is removing an important influence on HRV (but see #AUTHOR_TAG and Taylor, 2007)."

CCT530	30903216	Considerations in the assessment of heart rate variability in biobehavioral research	Daniel Quintana	The LF/HF ratio does not accurately measure cardiac sympatho-vagal balance	"[""George E. Billman""]"	"Power spectral analysis of the beat-to-beat variations of heart rate or the heart period (R-R interval) has become widely used to quantify cardiac autonomic regulation (Appel et al., 1989; Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996; Berntson et al., 1997; Denver et al., 2007; Thayler et al., 2010; Billman, 2011). This technique partitions the total variance (the ""power"") of a continuous series of beats into its frequency components, typically identifying two or three main peaks: Very Low Frequency (VLF) <0.04 Hz, Low Frequency (LF), 0.04-0.15 Hz, and High Frequency (HF) 0.15-0.4 Hz. It should be noted that the HF peak is shifted to a higher range (typically 0.24-1.04 Hz) in infants and during exercise (Berntson et al., 1997). The HF peak is widely believed to reflect cardiac parasympathetic nerve activity while the LF, although more complex, is often assumed to have a dominant sympathetic component (Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, 1996; Berntson et al., 1997; Billman, 2011). Based upon these assumptions, Pagani and co-workers proposed that the ratio of LF to HF (LF/HF) could be used to quantify the changing relationship between sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve activities (i.e., the sympatho-vagal balance) (Pagani et al., 1984, 1986; Malliani et al., 1991) in both health and disease. However, this concept has been challenged (Kingwell et al., 1994; Koh et al., 1994; Hopf et al., 1995; Eckberg, 1997; Houle and Billman, 1999; Billman, 2011). Despite serious and largely under-appreciated limitations, the LF/HF ratio has gained wide acceptance as a tool to assess cardiovascular autonomic regulation where increases in LF/HF are assumed to reflect a shift to ""sympathetic dominance"" and decreases in this index correspond to a ""parasympathetic dominance."" Therefore, it is vital to provide a critical assessment of the assumptions upon which this concept is based."	"However, here sympathetic outflow was indexed by normalized low frequency HRV -which is not straightforwardly related to SNS activity (e.g., Grassi and Esler, 1999;Moak et al., 2007;Goedhart et al., 2008;Billman, 2011#AUTHOR_TAG , 2013a -so this latter claim requires further empirical support using indices that more directly index cardiac sympathetic outflow."	"[""One compromise solution is to measure a participant's natural breathing rate, and use the derived frequency for respiratory pacing (e.g., Elstad, 2012)."", 'While this approach has utility during resting state registration, this procedure may inadvertently influence HRV during emotional or cognitive tasks as the participant has to consciously follow the pacing cue, in addition to paying attention to the experimental task -dual attention, in a number of contexts, significantly increases task difficulty (Pashler, 1994).', 'Zhang et al. (2010) argue that cardiorespiratory coupling during a cognitive task can be influenced either by activation of the motor cortex, which deceases cardiorespiratory coupling, or via increases in SNS activity from completing a cognitive task.', 'However, here sympathetic outflow was indexed by normalized low frequency HRV -which is not straightforwardly related to SNS activity (e.g., Grassi and Esler, 1999;Moak et al., 2007;Goedhart et al., 2008;Billman, 2011#AUTHOR_TAG , 2013a -so this latter claim requires further empirical support using indices that more directly index cardiac sympathetic outflow.']"	0
CCT531	30903216	Considerations in the assessment of heart rate variability in biobehavioral research	Daniel Quintana	Heart Rate Variability ? A Historical Perspective	"[""George E. Billman""]"	"Heart rate variability (HRV), the beat-to-beat variation in either heart rate or the duration of the R-R interval - the heart period, has become a popular clinical and investigational tool. The temporal fluctuations in heart rate exhibit a marked synchrony with respiration (increasing during inspiration and decreasing during expiration - the so called respiratory sinus arrhythmia, RSA) and are widely believed to reflect changes in cardiac autonomic regulation. Although the exact contributions of the parasympathetic and the sympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system to this variability are controversial and remain the subject of active investigation and debate, a number of time and frequency domain techniques have been developed to provide insight into cardiac autonomic regulation in both health and disease. It is the purpose of this essay to provide an historical overview of the evolution in the concept of HRV. Briefly, pulse rate was first measured by ancient Greek physicians and scientists. However, it was not until the invention of the ""Physician's Pulse Watch"" (a watch with a second hand that could be stopped) in 1707 that changes in pulse rate could be accurately assessed. The Rev. Stephen Hales (1733) was the first to note that pulse varied with respiration and in 1847 Carl Ludwig was the first to record RSA. With the measurement of the ECG (1895) and advent of digital signal processing techniques in the 1960s, investigation of HRV and its relationship to health and disease has exploded. This essay will conclude with a brief description of time domain, frequency domain, and non-linear dynamic analysis techniques (and their limitations) that are commonly used to measure HRV."	"While it may be the case that HRV can be used as a neurobiological index of interpersonal interaction, significant caveats exist due to the complicated nature of HRV and consequently uncertainty regarding what information is actually provided by common HRV indices (Berntson et al., 1997;Malpas, 2002;#AUTHOR_TAG, 2011)."

The main aim of the present study was to perform an in-depth assessment of absolute and relative reliability of standard indexes of HRV from short-term laboratory recordings. In 39 healthy subjects [mean age (min-max): 38 (26-56) years; 18 men and 21 women] we recorded 5 min of supine ECG during spontaneous and paced (15 breaths/min) breathing. The test was repeated on the next day under the same conditions. From the RR intervals we computed standard indexes of HRV: SDNN (S.D. of RR interval values), RMSSD (root-mean-square of successive RR interval differences), LF (low frequency) and HF (high frequency) power (absolute and normalized units) and LF/HF. Absolute reliability was assessed by 95% limits of random variation; relative reliability was assessed by the ICC (intraclass correlation coefficient). The sample size needed to detect a mean difference > or =30% of the between-subject S.D. was also estimated. Although there was no significant mean change between the two tests, we found that in individual subjects the second measurement was as high/low as 1.9/0.5 times (SDNN, best case) and 3.5/0.3 times (LF/HF, worst case) the first measurement, due to pure random variation. For most parameters the ICC was >0.8 (range 0.65-0.88). The estimated sample size ranged from 24-98 subjects. Reliability indexes tended to improve during paced breathing. We conclude that short-term HRV parameters are subject to large day-to-day random variations. Random error, however, represents a limited part of the between-subject variability; therefore observed differences between individuals mostly reflect differences in the subjects' error-free value rather than random error.

We have suggested that this coherence is the result of triggering of inspiratory onset by a preceding cardiovascular afferent. One implication of this triggering hypothesis is that coupling should only exist under conditions of spontaneous ventilation and not under conditions where the ventilatory period is fixed, as during intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV). This study compared the degree of CVC in 20 ASA I female subjects, aged 21-50 yr, 10 of whom were breathing spontaneously and 10 were undergoing mechanical ventilation. Over 5-10 min, we recorded the timing of consecutive ECG R waves and inspiratory onsets. Coupling was demonstrated by examining these epochs for constant timing relationship between R waves and inspiration (RI intervals). Constancy of RI intervals was examined graphically (RI plot) and quantitatively using the Shannon entropy of RI interval distribution. We observed CVC in all spontaneously breathing subjects but in none of those receiving IPPV. In spontaneously breathing subjects, temporal alignment with inspiratory onset was greatest for the heart beat preceding inspiration.

We then examined the relationships between the presence of cardioventilatory coupling in these epochs and the plot appearance and entropy measures derived from these plots. We observed that coupling was significantly associated with the presence of banding in the raw heart rate and RR consecutive difference time series, and with discrete clustering within the RR consecutive difference phase portrait.

The stomach was distended by means of a barostat, using a single staircase protocol by which pressure was increased by 2 mmHg every 3 min. Gastric sensory function was assessed at each distension step by using a visual analog scale (VAS) for sensations of fullness, nausea and pain. For comparison, we also performed a cold pressor test. The MSNA increased on barostat-induced gastric distension with an almost concomitant elevation of blood pressure. The increase in both was proportional to the intragastric pressure and both decreased towards initial values after the end of distension. Heart rate increased inconsistently and only at higher distension pressures that were associated with high VAS scores. The opposite was found for the cold pressor test. The results of this study confirm the existence of a functional relationship between gastrointestinal distension and cardiovascular function. Decrease in this gastrovascular response may play a role in postprandial hypotension in the elderly, since the MSNA responses to simulated microgravity decrease with age."

"[""Harold Pashler""]"	"People often have trouble performing 2 relatively simple tasks concurrently. The causes of this interference and its implications for the nature of attentional limitations have been controversial for 40 years, but recent experimental findings are beginning to provide some answers. Studies of the psychological refractory period effect indicate a stubborn bottleneck encompassing the process of choosing actions and probably memory retrieval generally, together with certain other cognitive operations. Other limitations associated with task preparation, sensory-perceptual processes, and timing can generate additional and distinct forms of interference. These conclusions challenge widely accepted ideas about attentional resources and probe reaction time methodologies. They also suggest new ways of thinking about continuous dual-task performance, effects of extraneous stimulation (e.g.. stop signals), and automaticity. Implications for higher mental processes are discussed. For more than 100 years, psychologists have been interested in people&apos;s ability (or inability) to perform two or more activities concurrently.

The whole system consists of two-lead electrocardiogram acquisition using conductive textile electrodes located in bed, baseline fluctuation elimination, R-wave detection, adjustment of sudden change in R-wave area using moving average, and optimal lead selection. In order to solve the problems of previous algorithms for the ECG-derived respiration (EDR) signal acquisition, we are proposing a method for the optimal lead selection. An optimal EDR signal among the three EDR signals derived from each lead (and arctangent of their ratio) is selected by estimating the instantaneous frequency using the Hilbert transform, and then choosing the signal with minimum variation of the instantaneous frequency.

Previous suggestions to address this problem are unlikely to be effective. For example, a journal of negative results publishes otherwise unpublishable reports.

Geider"", ""Hugh L. Maclntyre"", ""Todd M. Kana""]"	"A new regulatory model can describe acclimation of phytoplankton growth rate (p), chlorophyll a : carbon ratio and nitrogen: carbon ratio to irradiance, temperature and nutrient availability. The model uses three indices of phytoplankton biomass-phytoplankton carbon (C), phytoplankton nitrogen (N), and chlorophyll a (Chl). The model links the light-saturated rate of photosynthesis to N: C, requires that Chl a synthesis be coupled to nitrogen assimilation, and includes several regulatory features. These include feedback inhibition of the nitrogen assimilation rate by increases in the N: C ratio, as well as regulation of Chl a synthesis by the balance between light absorption and photosynthetic carbon fixation. The model treats respiration as the sum of the maintenance metabolic requirement and the cost of biosynthesis. In addition, the model can account for accumulation and mobilization of energy reserves (i.e. variability of N: C) and photoacclimation (i.e. variability of Chl : N and Chl : C) in response to variations in irradiance and nutrient availability. The assumptions of the model are shown to be in agreement with experimental observations and the model output compares favorably with data for cultures in balanced and unbalanced growth. The light-, nutrient-, and temperature-dependencies of phytoplankton growth rate have often been modeled separately. Phytoplankton growth rate has been treated as a function of the dissolved nutrient concentration using the Monod equation or as a function of the cellular content (or quota) of limiting nutrient using the Droop equation (McCarthy 1980; Droop 1983; Morel 1987). Under conditions of balanced growth, the Droop and Monod equations are consistent with each other and with Michaelis-Menten nutrient uptake kinetics (Morel 1987). The temperature-dependence of growth rate has been treated as an exponential dependence or an Arrhenius equation, although other functions have also been used (Eppley 1972; Li 1980; Ahlgren 1987).

The N:P ratio of algae and cyanobacteria is very plastic in nutrient-limited cells, ranging from <5 mol N:mol P when phosphate is available greatly in excess of nitrate or ammonium to <100 mol N:mol P when inorganic N is present greatly in excess of P. Under optimal nutrient-replete growth conditions, the cellular N:P ratio is somewhat more constrained, ranging from 5 to 19 mol N:mol P, with most observations below the Redfield ratio of 16. Limited data indicate that the critical N:P that marks the transition between N- and P-limitation of phytoplankton growth lies in the range 20-50 mol N:mol P, considerably in excess of the Redfield ratio. Biochemical composition can be used to constrain the critical N:P. Although the biochemical data do not preclude the critical N:P from being as high as 50, the typical biochemical composition of nutrient-replete algae and cyanobacteria suggests that the critical N:P is more likely to lie in the range between 15 and 30. Despite the observation that the overall average N:P composition of marine particulate matter closely approximates the Redfield ratio of 16, there are significant local variations with a range from 5 to 34. Consistent with the culture studies, lowest values of N:P are associated with nitrate- and phosphate-replete conditions. The highest values of N:P are observed in oligotrophic waters and are within the range of critical N:P observed in cultures, but are not so high as to necessarily invoke P-limitation. The C:N ratio is also plastic. The average C:N ratios of nutrientreplete phytoplankton cultures, oceanic particulate matter and inorganic N and C draw-down are slightly greater than the Redfield ratio of 6.6. Neither the analysis of laboratory C:N:P data nor a more theoretical approach based on the relative abundance of the major biochemical molecules in the phytoplankton can support the contention that the Redfield N:P reflects a physiological or biochemical constraint on the elemental composition of primary production."

Redfield observed a similarity between the elemental composition of marine plankton in the surface ocean and dissolved nutrients in the ocean interior 1 . This stoichiometry, referred to as the Redfield ratio, continues to be a central tenet in ocean biogeochemistry, and is used to infer a variety of ecosystem processes, such as phytoplankton productivity and rates of nitrogen fixation and loss 2-4 . Model, field and laboratory studies have shown that different mechanisms can explain both constant and variable ratios of carbon to nitrogen and phosphorus among ocean plankton communities. The range of C/N/P ratios in the ocean, and their predictability, are the subject of much active research 5-12 . Here we assess global patterns in the elemental composition of phytoplankton and particulate organic matter in the upper ocean, using published and unpublished observations of particulate phosphorus, nitrogen and carbon from a broad latitudinal range, supplemented with elemental data for surface plankton populations. We show that the elemental ratios of marine organic matter exhibit large spatial variations, with a global average that differs substantially from the canonical Redfield ratio. However, elemental ratios exhibit a clear latitudinal trend. Specifically, we observed a ratio of 195:28:1 in the warm nutrient-depleted low-latitude gyres, 137:18:1 in warm, nutrient-rich upwelling zones, and 78:13:1 in cold, nutrient-rich high-latitude regions. We suggest that the coupling between oceanic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycles may vary systematically by ecosystem. A. C. Redfield first noted the similarity between the particulate nutrient ratios of plankton living in the surface ocean and that of dissolved nutrients in the deep ocean 1 . He predicted that deep-ocean nutrient ratios were controlled by the uniform nutrient requirements of sinking, and subsequently remineralized, surface plankton. This concept remains a central tenet in our understanding of ocean biogeochemistry. However, model, field and laboratory studies have shown that different mechanisms can explain both constant and variable C/N/P ratios among ocean plankton communities, but the range of ratios in the ocean and the relative importance of each mechanism are subject to much research 510,13,14 . Despite this continued lack of understanding of global patterns, the N/P ratio is routinely used to draw conclusions about ocean ecosystem processes, particularly related to nutrient limitation of phytoplankton production and the net magnitude of N2 fixation and denitrification. 2,3 .

Spilling"", ""A. Kremp"", ""R. Klais"", ""K. Olli"", ""T.

Recent evidence suggests that their competition is significantly affected by climatic fac- tors under ongoing change, modifying especially the condi- tions for cold-water, spring bloom communities in temper- ate and Arctic regions. We investigated the effects of phy- toplankton community composition on spring bloom car- bon flows and nutrient stoichiometry in multiyear mesocosm experiments. Comparison of differing communities showed that community structure significantly affected C accumu- lation parameters, with highest particulate organic carbon (POC) buildup and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) release in diatom-dominated communities. In terms of inorganic nu- trient drawdown and bloom accumulation phase, the domi- nating groups behaved as functional surrogates. Dominance patterns, however, significantly affected C : N : P : Chl a ra- tios over the whole bloom event: when diatoms were domi- nant, these ratios increased compared to dinoflagellate dom- inance or mixed communities. Diatom-dominated communi- ties sequestered carbon up to 3.6-fold higher than the expec- tation based on the Redfield ratio, and 2-fold higher com- pared to dinoflagellate dominance. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental report of consequences of climatically driven shifts in phytoplankton dominance patterns for carbon sequestration and related biogeochemical cycles in coastal seas. Our results also highlight the need for remote sensing technologies with taxonomical resolution, as the C : Chla ra- tio was strongly dependent on community composition and bloom stage. Climate-driven changes in phytoplankton domi- nance patterns will have far-reaching consequences for major biogeochemical cycles and need to be considered in climate change scenarios for marine systems."

The spring bloom in the Baltic Sea is dominated by both diatoms and dinoflagellates. However, the sedimentation of these groups is different: diatoms tend to sink to the sea floor at the end of the bloom, while dinoflagellates to a large degree are been remineralized in the euphotic zone. Understanding phytoplankton competition and species specific ecological strategies is thus of importance for assessing indirect effects of phytoplankton community composition on eutrophication problems.   The main objective of this thesis was to describe some basic physiological and ecological characteristics of the main cold-water diatoms and dinoflagellates in the Baltic Sea. This was achieved by specific studies of: (1) seasonal vertical positioning, (2) dinoflagellate life cycle, (3) mixotrophy, (4) primary production, respiration and growth and (5) diatom silicate uptake, using cultures of common cold-water diatoms: Chaetoceros wighamii, C. gracilis, Pauliella taeniata, Thalassiosira baltica, T. levanderi, Melosira arctica, Diatoma tenuis, Nitzschia frigida, and dinoflagellates: Peridiniella catenata, Woloszynskia halophila and Scrippsiella hangoei.   The diatoms had higher primary production capacity and lower respiration rate compared with the dinoflagellates. This difference was reflected in the maximum growth rate, which for the examined diatoms range from 0.6 to 1.2 divisions d-1, compared with 0.2 to 0.3 divisions d-1 for the dinoflagellates. Among diatoms there were species specific differences in light utilization and uptake of silicate, and C. wighamii had the highest carbon assimilation capacity and maximum silicate uptake.   The physiological properties of diatoms and dinoflagellates were used in a model of the onset of the spring bloom: for the diatoms the model could predict the initiation of the spring bloom; S. hangoei, on the other hand, could not compete successfully and did not obtain positive growth in the model. The other dinoflagellates did not have higher growth rates or carbon assimilation rates and would thus probably not perform better than S. hangoei in the model. The dinoflagellates do, however, have competitive advantages that were not included in the model: motility and mixotrophy.   Previous investigations has revealed that the chain-forming P. catenata performs diurnal vertical migration (DVM), and the results presented here suggest that active positioning in the water column, in addition to DVM, is a key element in this species' life strategy. There was indication of mixotrophy in S. hangoei, as it produced and excreted the enzyme leucine aminopeptidase (LAP). Moreover, there was indirect evidence that W. halophila obtains carbon from other sources than photosynthesis when comparing increase in cell numbers with in situ carbon assimilation rates. The results indicate that mixotrophy is a part of the strategy of vernal dinoflagellates in the Baltic Sea. There were also indications that the seeding of the spring bloom is very important for the dinoflagellates to succeed. In mesocosm experiments dinoflagellates could not compete with diatoms when their initial numbers were low.   In conclusion, this thesis has provided new information about the basic physiological and ecological properties of the main cold-water phytoplankton in the Baltic Sea. The main phytoplankton groups, diatoms and dinoflagellates, have different physiological properties, which clearly separate their life strategies. The information presented here could serve as further steps towards better prognostic models of the effects of eutrophication in the Baltic Sea.Overgodningen av Ostersjon ar ett valkant problem som fororsakas av manskligt utslapp av kvave och fosfor.

Kiselalgerna hade hogre primar produktion och lagre respiration an dinoflagellaterna. Denna skillnad reflekterades ocksa i den maximala tillvaxthastigheten som for kiselalgerna var 0.6-1.2 delningar per dag och for dinoflagellaterna 0.2-0.3 delningar per dag. Bland kiselalgerna var det ocksa arts specifika skillnader i anvandandet av ljus och upptagandet av silikat. C. wighamii hade den hogsta primarproduktionen, silikatupptag och maximal tillvaxthastighet.   De fysiologiska egenskaperna hos kiselalgerna och dinoflagellaterna blev anvanda i en modell av tidpunkten for varblomningen. For kiselalgerna kunde modellen forutspa varblomingens borjan men dinoflagellaterna fick inte positiv vaxt i modellen. Dessa arter finns i Ostersjon under varen och maste darfor ha andra konkurrensegenskaper som inte var med i modellen sa som mobilitet och mixotrofi (formagan till att uppta naring i organisk form).   Den kolonibildande dinoflagellaten P. catenata ar en god simmare, och resultaten indikerar att aktiv positionering i vattenpelaren ar viktigt for denna arts ekologiska strategi.

To examine this, the interactions between temperature, photoperiod and light exposure (LE) (integral daily light supply) on specific growth rates were analysed for Limnothrix redekei, Planktothrix agardhii (cyanobacteria), Nitzschia acicularis and Stephanodiscus minutulus (diatoms). A model of factor interactions was developed based on new (P. agardhii and St. minutulus) and previously published laboratory studies. It describes the measured data with high precision. Temperature and photoperiod affect the parameters of the light-growth response curve differently, but these effects are the same for all species. The link between functions for temperature and photoperiod is more species-specific. Using meteorological data, the model developed here was used to study the interplay of these factors during a spring bloom in Lake Muggelsee (Berlin). It was found that while all three factors influenced phytoplankton growth, temperature and photoperiod were more important than LE. Both the intensities of the factors and the interactions between them influenced each species to a different degree.

Uptake velocity is a function of both internal and external substrate concentrations and can be described by the kinetics of noncompetitive enzyme inhibition. The concentrations of polyphosphates (alkali-extractable or 7-min) can he substituted as inhibitors in the kinetic equation. The apparent half-saturation constant of uptake. Km, is 0.6 _M. The apparent half-saturation concentration for growth is less than Km, by 1 order of magnitude. Growth is a function of cellular P concentrations, and the polyphosphates (alkali-extractable or 7-min) appear to regulate growth rate directly or indirectly. To understand P limitation, therefore, it is necessary to measure both external P and internal polyphosphate levels. Evidence indicates that alkali-extractable polyphosphates, which can be quantitatively determined by a simple method of measuring surplus P, are involved in cell division process find that a maintenance concentration of functional phosphate exists in the form of poly phosphates. Alkaline phosphatase activity has an inversely linear relationship to growth rate and to the reciprocals of both polyphosphates and surplus P.

Cell N remained constant up to the optimal ratio and increased linearly with N:P above it. The level of cell P was high at low N:P (N-limited state) but decreased rapidly until N:P approached the optimal and remained constant at a low level at high N:P (P-limited state).

Recently, the presence of such a global attractor for optimal phytoplankton stoichiometry has been questioned in models and empirical analyses. As the chemical composition of phytoplankton is of major importance for our understanding of global elemental cycles and biogeochemical transformations, we assembled 55 data sets of phytoplankton growth rate and biomass N : P ratios in a meta-analysis testing (1) whether phytoplankton N : P converges at high growth rates, (2) whether N : P ratios scale with growth rate, and (3) whether the optimal N : P ratios achieved at highest growth rates reflect organism traits or environmental conditions. Across systems and species, phytoplankton N : P decreased with increasing growth rate and at the same time showed decreasing variance, i.e., fast-growing phytoplankton is more P rich and has a more confined elemental composition. Optimal N : P increased with increasing N : P of available nutrients, i.e., with increasing P limitation. Other differences were rare, except cyanobacteria showed higher optimal N : P than diatoms. Understanding the role of phytoplankton in biogeochemical transformation requires modeling approaches that are stoichiometrically flexible to reflect the dynamics of growth and nutrient supply in primary producers."

Among various factors affecting organism stoichiometry, differences in C_:_P and N_:_P stoichiometry have been hypothesized to reflect organismal P-content because of altered allocation to P-rich ribosomal RNA at different growth rates (the growth rate hypothesis, GRH). We tested the GRH using data for microbes, insects, and crustaceans and we show here that growth, RNA content, and biomass P content are tightly coupled across species, during ontogeny, and under physiological P limitation. We also show, however, that this coupling is relaxed when P is not limiting for growth.

Yoder""]"	"Phytoplankton growth rate in response to irradiance can be approximated by a hyperbola defined by three coefficients: i) initial slope (_); ii) asymptote (_m); and, iii) X-axis intercept or compensation irradiance (Ic). To mathematically represent the interaction of temperature and irradiance on growth rate, one must describe the relationship between these constants and temperature. The marine diatom, Skeletonema costatum (Greville) Cleve, was grown in unialgal culture at different levels of irradiance and 2-3 photoperiods at 0, 5, 10, 16 and 22 C. The value of Ic is ca. 1.0 lyáday_1 or less at all temperatures. The initial slope (divály_1) is a Òu-shapedÓ function of temperature described by the second degree polynomial, _= 0.25Ð0.02T+0.001T2. Within the range 0Ð10 C, _m (diváday_1) is an exponential function of temperature described by the equation, _m= 0.48 exp (0.126T). At each temperature and selected levels of irradiance, cell size and cellular content of C, N and chl a were determined. The C:chl a and N:chl a ratios increased with irradiance because of increases in C and decreases in chl a. At lower temperatures (0, 5, 10 C), the rate of increase of both ratios with irradiance was greater than at the higher temperatures (16, 22 C). Cellular content of N was independent of irradiance and temperature, and the C:N ratio ranged from 5 to 8 with a slight tendency to lower values at low irradiance. Cell volume was not influenced by either temperature or irradiance."

Downwelling irradiance, mixing depth and the ability of the phytoplankton community to utilize the light, are key parameters determining the timing of the onset of the spring bloom. Knowing these parameters would thus provide tools for modeling the spring bloom and enhance our knowledge of ecophysiological processes during this period. Our main objective with this study was to provide data for the growth characteristics of some key species forming the spring bloom in the Gulf of Finland, and to apply those results in a simple dynamic model for the onset of the spring bloom, in order to test if the timing of the spring bloom predicted by the models corresponds to field observations. We investigated the photosynthetic characteristics of three diatoms and two dinoflagellates ( Chaetoceros wighamii , Melosira arctica , Thalassiosira baltica , Scrippsiella hangoei and Woloszynskia halophila ), at low temperatures (4-5 degC). All of these species are common during spring bloom in the Baltic Sea. Cultures of these species were acclimated to different irradiance regimes prior to measurements of photosynthesis, respiration, pigment concentration and light absorption. We did not find a positive relationship between respiration and growth rate, and we hypothesize that this relationship, which is well established at higher temperatures, is negligible or absent at low temperatures ( P m ), and maximum light utilization coefficient ( a ) was lowest and respiration ( R ) highest in the dinoflagellates. We made a model of the onset of the spring bloom in the western part of Gulf of Finland, using the obtained data together with monitoring data of mixing depth and water transparency from this area. Model results were compared to field observations of chlorophyll- a (Chl- a ) concentration. There was a good agreement between the model predictions and the observed onset of the spring bloom for the diatoms. S. hangoei , however, was not able to reach positive production in the model, and W. halophila had the similar growth characteristics as S. hangoei . Consequently, these species must have other competition strategies enabling them to exist and grow during spring bloom."

A binning approach was developed to classify water quality. Least-impaired conditions had relatively high water column transparency and low concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and orthophosphate. Reference communities in all seasons and salinity zones are characterized by consistently low values of chlorophyll a and pheophytin coupled with relatively stable proportions of the phytoplankton taxonomic groups and low biomasses of key bloom-forming species. Chlorophyll cell content was lower and less variable and average cell size and seasonal picophytoplankton biomass tended to be greater in the mesohaline and polyhaline reference communities as compared to the impaired communities. Biomass concentrations of the nano-micro phytoplankton size fractions (2-200 _m) in 12 of the 16 season-specific and salinity-specific reference communities were the same or higher than those in impaired habitat conditions, suggesting that nutrient reductions will not decrease the quantity of edible phytoplankton food available to large consumers. High (bloom) and low (bust) biomass events within the impaired phytoplankton communities showed strikingly different chlorophyll cell content and turnover rates. Freshwater flow had little effect on phytoplankton responses to water quality condition in most of the estuary. Improved water column transparency, or clarity, through the reduction of suspended sediments will be particularly important in attaining the reference communities.

GEIDER""]"	"The carbon:chlorophyll a ratio (C:chl a or _) is a sensitive indicator of physiological state in microalgae. The dependence of _ on photon flux density (PFD or I) and temperature in exponentially growing nutrient-sufficient microalgae can be described by an empirical equation with four coefficients. C:chl a increases linearly with increased light level at constant temperature and decreases exponentially with increased temperature at constant light level. Both the slope (_) and intercept (_0) of linear regressions of _ on photon flux density increase at low temperature. The intercept, _0, increases from 6 to 40 g of carbon per gram of chlorophyll a (g C g chl a-1) between 30 and 0 _C and _ increases by over an order of magnitude from 0.04 to 1.9 g C g chl a-1 m2 s _mol photon-1 over the same temperature range. Low-temperature chlorosis can be interpreted as an adaptive response in the allocation of cell resources between temperature-independent biophysical reactions involved in light-harvesting and temperature-dependent biochemical reactions. This response also reduces the potential for photoinhibitory damage at high light levels which can be exacerbated by low temperatures. The range of values for _ in nature has not been adequately determined because of difficulty in separating phytoplankton from detritus, bacteria and microzooplankton. Based on the laboratory observations summarized in this paper, it would appear that use of a single value of _ for phytoplankton is inappropriate for ecological studies. For example, at a PFD of 50 _ mol m-2 s-1, _ increases from 10 to 130 g C g chl a-1 between 30 and 0 _C under nutrient-sufficient conditions. These conclusions are based on observations for eight diatoms, two green algae, one euglenoid and two cyanobacteria for which the appropriate data are available. In contrast to these groups, the dinoflagellates contain substantially less chlorophyll a. The available data indicate that _ is about three times larger in dinoflagellates than in other algae under comparable PFDs at 20 _C. There are insufficient data available, however, to evaluate the light and temperature dependence of _ in dinoflagellates."

In this work, we tested three different formulations for computing the modelled Chla in a 3D coupled hydrodynamical-biogeochemical model of the Southwest lagoon of New Caledonia. The first formulation considers a constant Chla:C ratio. In the second one, Chla is a diagnostic variable related to the variable phytoplankton nitrogen-to-carbon ratio. In the last formulation, Chla is a state variable of the model, which is dynamically simulated. Results showed important differences between the formulations, the first leading to overestimate the Chla concentration in low nutrients conditions. Thus, this study strengthens the importance of the Chla modelling in a coupled model in order to better estimate a crucial variable for validation of ecosystem models."

A simple conceptual model was then developed to infer in situ phytoplankton car bon as a function of chlorophyll a. This allowed indirect estimates of the carbon-to-chlorophyll ratio of phytoplankton in the sea. Using data from high-performance liquid chromatography, field samples dominated by diatoms, dinoflagellates, green algae, prymnesiophytes and cyanobacteria were iden tified, and their carbon-to-chlorophyll ratios were established. The computations yielded conserva tive estimates for the ratio (15 to 176 weight:weight). The results were applied to satellite data to map the carbon-to-chlorophyll ratios in the NW Atlantic. Since methods were already in place to estimate photosynthesis- irradiance parameters for the region by remote sensing (Piatt et al. 2008), we showed that it was possible, using remote sensing, to compute carbon-based phytoplankton growth rates by making use of the existing information on photosynthesis-irradiance parameters and carbon-to-chlorophyll ratios. The method makes it possible to compute primary production by using either carbon-based growth models or photosynthesis-irradiance models in ways that are fully comparable with each other.

Baird"", ""Peter J. Ralph"", ""Farhan Rizwi"", ""Karen Wild-Allen"", ""Andrew D. L.

The geometric derivation highlights the non-linear relationship between Chl content and absorption due to the package effect. When parameterized for a generic 3 mm radius phytoplankton cell, the model reproduces the magnitude and daily variations of C: Chl and C: nitrogen ratios of the diatom Skeletonema costatum in published laboratory experiments. The parameterization is then applied in a three-dimensional biogeochemical model containing three phytoplankton classes in the coastal waters off southeast Tasmania, Australia, which demonstrates the behavior of the dynamic Chl parameterization over a range of light-and nutrient-limiting environments for phytoplankton of different sizes and growth rates. The model produces C: Chl ratios of ~12-20 (weight: weight) and ~60-80 for phytoplankton communities dominated by fast-growing small and fast-growing large cells, respectively, close to the ratios of 17 and 76 observed at two sampling stations during periods with diatom-and flagellate-dominated communities. Throughout the simulation, community C: Chl ratios generally vary between 12 and 200, which is similar to the range observed globally. In the new parameterization, C: Chl ratios are most influenced by the package effect for light-limited, slow-growing large microalgae, with physiological processes becoming important for smaller, nutrient-limited, fast-growing microalgae.

The properties of the model's steadystates are described as a guide to its behaviour and to parameter sensitivity. Seasonal cycles of chlorophyll a and C :chl a within the upper 200 m of the ocean were predicted at latitudes ranging from 0"" to 60"" N. Although limited to a consideration of physiological acclimation of a single taxon, our results compared well with observations. Predicted values of C : chl a ranged from 20 to >l60 g C g-l chl a. Lowest values of C :chl a were predicted for the top of the nutricline within the seasonal thermocline in mid-summer. Highest values of C :chl a were predicted for the nutrient-depleted surface mixed layer in mid-summer. The seasonal range of C :chl a was greatest in tropical and subtropical waters and least at 60degN. Predictions of the vertical distribution of C:chl a at 20degN were consistent with published observations for the subtropical North Pacific Ocean. Predictions of the relationship between C : chl a and chlorophyll a In surface waters showed qualitative agreement with published observations for the North Atlantic Ocean. The value of C:chl a within the surface mixed layer depends on the mean irradiance within the surface mixed layer and the extent of draw-down of the limiting nutrient (nitrate) from winter/spring maxima. A balance between phytoplankton growth and loss to grazing led to quasisteady-state conditions in the mixed layer In summer. Parameterisation of grazing was a critical determinant of summer C:chl a. Another cntical parameter was the physiologically determined minimum value of C : chl a.

Both assimilation numbers at saturating light levels and the slopes of the light-limited portions of the photosynthesis versus irradiance curves were smaller than in algae from lower latitudes. However, both parameters increased significantly with rising temperatures. Light-saturated photosynthesis on the average exhibited a Q10-value of ca. 4.2 between-1.5degC and +2degC. Light-limited photosynthesis between-1.5degC and +5degC rose at a rate corresponding to a Q10-value of roughly 2.6. Above +5degC, temperature enhancement of both light-saturated and light-limited photosynthetic rates was minimal or absent. Our results suggest that under extremely low temperatures light-limited photosynthetic rates become temperature-dependent due to changes in maximum quantum yields."

"[""Shoroog Agou"", ""David Locker"", ""Vanessa Muirhead"", ""Bryan Tompson"", ""David L. Streiner""]"	"Although the associations between oral biologic variables such as malocclusion and oral-health-related quality of life (OHRQOL) have been explored, little research has been done to address the influence of psychological characteristics on perceived OHRQOL. The aim of this study was to assess OHRQOL outcomes in orthodontics while controlling for individual psychological characteristics. We postulated that children with better psychological well-being (PWB) would experience fewer negative OHRQOL impacts, regardless of their orthodontic treatment status.One hundred eighteen children (74 treatment and 44 on the waiting list), aged 11 to 14 years, seeking treatment at the orthodontic clinics at the University of Toronto, participated in this study. The child perception questionnaire (CPQ11-14) and the PWB subscale of the child health questionnaire were administered at baseline and follow-up. Occlusal changes were assessed by using the dental aesthetic index. A waiting-list comparison group was used to account for age-related effects.Although the treatment subjects had significantly better OHRQOL scores at follow-up, the results were significantly modified by each subject's PWB status (P <0.01). Furthermore, multivariate analysis showed that PWB contributed significantly to the variance in CPQ11-14 scores (26%). In contrast, the amount of variance explained by the treatment status alone was relatively small (9%).The results of this study support the postulated mediator role of PWB when evaluating OHRQOL outcomes in children undergoing orthodontic treatment. Children with better PWB are, in general, more likely to report better OHRQOL regardless of their orthodontic treatment status. On the other hand, children with low PWB, who did not receive orthodontic treatment, experienced worse OHRQOL compared with those who received treatment. This suggests that children with low PWB can benefit from orthodontic treatment. Nonetheless, further work, with larger samples and longer follow-ups, is needed to confirm this finding and to improve our understanding of how other psychological factors relate to patients' OHRQOL.Copyright (c) 2011.

For those participants for whom having a malocclusion impacted on their lives, concerns were about self-consciousness with dental appearance. On analysis of the content validity some items were felt to be relevant to the impact of malocclusion, particularly questions from the emotional and social well-being subscales; however, other questions were felt not to be relevant. Concerns about face validity were expressed about several facets of the measure including the response format, the use of 'double' questions and interpretation of certain words.Concerns were expressed by young people with malocclusions about the face and content validity of CPQ ISF-16.

Results: The CPQ11-14 scores were significantly related to the self-esteem scores and the DAI ratings. Regression analysis showed that self-esteem contributed significantly to the variance in CPQ11-14 scores. However, the amount of variance explained by normative measures of malocclusion was relatively small. Conclusions: The impact of malocclusion on quality of life is substantial in children with low self-esteem.

Data came from the Longitudinal Study of Generations. Analyses were based on 5 assessments across a 12-year period of a sample of 1,824 individuals ages 16 to 97 years. First, growth curve analyses indicated that self-esteem increases from adolescence to middle adulthood, reaches a peak at about age 50 years, and then decreases in old age. Second, cross-lagged regression analyses indicated that self-esteem is best modeled as a cause rather than a consequence of life outcomes. Third, growth curve analyses, with self-esteem as a time-varying covariate, suggested that self-esteem has medium-sized effects on life-span trajectories of affect and depression, small to medium-sized effects on trajectories of relationship and job satisfaction, a very small effect on the trajectory of health, and no effect on the trajectory of occupational status.

PBO scores (and their means for that matter) are intrinsically meaningless, and differences in means between groups mask important and potentially different patterns in response within groups.

OHRQoL is a multidimensional construct that includes a subjective evaluation of the individual's oral health, functional well-being, emotional well-being, expectations and satisfaction with care, and sense of self. It has wide-reaching applications in survey and clinical research. OHRQoL is an integral part of general health and well-being. In fact, it is recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) as an important segment of the Global Oral Health Program (2003). This paper identifies the what, why, and how of OHRQoL and presents an oral health theoretical model. The relevance of OHRQoL for dental practitioners and patients in community-based dental practices is presented. Implications for health policy and related oral health disparities are also discussed. A supplemental Appendix contains a Medline and ProQuest literature search regarding OHRQoL research from 1990-2010 by discipline and research design (e.g., descriptive, longitudinal, clinical trial, etc.). The search identified 300 articles with a notable surge in OHRQoL research in pediatrics and orthodontics in recent years."

Steele"", ""David Locker""]"	"The terms 'health-related quality of life' and 'quality of life' are now in common use to describe the outcomes of oral health conditions and therapy for those conditions. In addition, there has been a proliferation of measures designed to quantify those outcomes. These measures, which were initially designated as socio-dental indicators or subjective oral health indicators are now more usually referred to as measures of oral health-related quality of life (OH-QoL). This is based on the assumption that the functional and psychosocial impacts they document must, of necessity, affect the quality of life. While this assumption has been subject to critical scrutiny in medicine, this is not the case with dentistry. Consequently, exactly what is being measured by indexes of OH-QoL is somewhat unclear. Based on the debate between Gill and Feinstein and Guyatt and Cook, we outline a number of criteria by means of which the construct addressed by measures of OH-QoL may be assessed. These are concerned with how the measures were developed and validated. These criteria are then used to appraise five of the many measures that have been developed over the past 20 years--the GOHAI, OHIP, OIDP, COHQoL and OH-QoL. The main conclusion is that while all document the frequency of the functional and psychosocial impacts that emanate from oral disorders they do not unequivocally establish the meaning and significance of those impacts. Consequently, the claim that oral disorders affect the quality of life has yet to be clearly demonstrated. Verifying this claim requires further qualitative studies of the outcomes of oral disorders as perceived by patients and persons, and the concurrent use of measures that more explicitly address the issue of quality of life."	#AUTHOR_TAG][100] Marshman and colleagues 101 have expressed concern that generic measures of OHQoL might not fully capture the impact that malocclusion has suggested the development of a malocclusion specific measure of OHQoL for young people with malocclusion.

METHODS: Data from two cross-sectional epidemiological studies of adolescents in Taranaki and Otago were used. Each participant completed a self-administered questionnaire and underwent a clinical examination. Information collected included sociodemographic characteristics (sex, ethnicity and household deprivation), and clinical measures (caries and malocclusion, the latter measured with the Dental Aesthetic Index, or DAI). OHRQoL was measured using the validated 16-item impact short-form Child Perceptions Questionnaire (CPQ11-14). Linear regression was used to model the CPQ11-14 score. RESULTS: 783 adolescents (52.6% male) took part. One-fifth had a handicapping malocclusion and one-third had a minor malocclusion or none. The overall mean DMFS was 2.3 (SD, 3.8), with slightly more than 50% being caries-free. With the exception of the oral symptoms domain, females presented with higher mean CPQ11-14 and domain scores, while Maori had lower scores. There was a distinct gradient in mean CPQ11-14 and domain scores across the categories of malocclusion severity, whereby those in the 'handicapping' category of the DAI had the highest CPQ11-14 score. Linear regression modeling of the CPQ11-14 score showed that, after controlling for DMFS and socio-demographic characteristics, malocclusion category and being female were positively associated with higher CPQ11-14 scores. CONCLUSION: A severe malocclusion appears to have a negative impact on the OHRQoL of New Zealand adolescents"	"A number of studies focusing on pre-school children, often aged 5 years or below, failed to demonstrate an association between the presence of a malocclusion and OHQoL, 87,88 whilst other studies based on adolescents between the approximate ages of 11 to 15 years, have found the presence of a malocclusion to have a negative impact on OHQoL. 74,89  arious factors may account for the disparity observed in the different age groups."

Adaptation assessments typically consider second-best worlds that incorporate the realities of market imperfections, institutional and informational constraints, delayed policy implementation, and other issues. As mitigation analyses increasingly consider the potential effectiveness of policies implemented under second-best world assumptions, it strikes us that their use of first-best and second-best benchmarks is becoming increasingly valuable. It also strikes us that adding the perspective of first-best worlds to adaptation analyses would do the same by providing comparable baselines for national and international assessments integrating the costs and benefits of adaptation and mitigation policies. In addition, adaptation analyses under first-best world assumptions could provide valuable information to policymakers on what could be achieved under ideal conditions. It would be very informative for science and policy to understand the benefits, trade-offs, human and financial resource requirements, and residual damages under first-best and second-best assumptions about the rate, extent, and timing of implementation of climate policies."

CCT618	81065436	A new scenario framework for Climate Change Research: scenario matrix architecture	Detlef Van Vuuren	A review of climate risk information for adaptation and development planning	"[""R. L. Wilby"", ""J. Troni"", ""Y. Biot"", ""L. Tedd"", ""B. C. Hewitson"", ""D. M. Smith"", ""R. T. Sutton""]"	"Although the use of climate scenarios for impact assessment has grown steadily since the 1990s, uptake of such information for adaptation is lagging by nearly a decade in terms of scientific output. Nonetheless, integration of climate risk information in development planning is now a priority for donor agencies because of the need to prepare for climate change impacts across different sectors and countries. This urgency stems from concerns that progress made against Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) could be threatened by anthropogenic climate change beyond 2015. Up to this time the human signal, though detectable and growing, will be a relatively small component of climate variability and change. This implies the need for a twin-track approach: on the one hand, vulnerability assessments of social and economic strategies for coping with present climate extremes and variability, and, on the other hand, development of climate forecast tools and scenarios to evaluate sector-specific, incremental changes in risk over the next few decades. This review starts by describing the climate outlook for the next couple of decades and the implications for adaptation assessments. We then review ways in which climate risk information is already being used in adaptation assessments and evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of three groups of techniques. Next we identify knowledge gaps and opportunities for improving the production and uptake of climate risk information for the 2020s. We assert that climate change scenarios can meet some, but not all, of the needs of adaptation planning. Even then, the choice of scenario technique must be matched to the intended application, taking into account local constraints of time, resources, human capacity and supporting infrastructure. We also show that much greater attention should be given to improving and critiquing models used for climate impact assessment, as standard practice. Finally, we highlight the over-arching need for the scientific community to provide more information and guidance on adapting to the risks of climate variability and change over nearer time horizons (i.e. the 2020s). Although the focus of the review is on information provision and uptake in developing regions, it is clear that many developed countries are facing the same challenges.

The objective of this paper is to describe patterns of weight change in the six sites of the World Health Organization (WHO) Multicentre Growth Reference Study (MGRS) and explore variables that explain variation in weight change within and between sites. Mothers of 1743 breastfed children enrolled in the MGRS had weights measured at days 7, 14, 28 and 42 post-partum, monthly from 2 to 12 months and bimonthly thereafter until 24 months post-partum. Height, maternal age, parity and employment status were recorded and breastfeeding was monitored throughout the follow-up. Weight change patterns varied significantly among sites. Ghanaian and Omani mothers lost little or gained weight post-partum. In Brazil, India, Norway and USA, mothers on average lost weight during the first year followed by stabilization in the second year. Lactation intensity and duration explained little of the variation in weight change patterns. In most sites, obese mothers tended to lose less weight than normal-weight mothers. In Brazil and Oman, primiparous mothers lost about 1 kg more than multiparous mothers in the first 6 months. In India and Ghana, multiparous mothers lost about 0.6 kg more than primiparas in the second 6 months. Culturally defined mother-care practices probably play a role in weight change patterns among lactating women. This hypothesis should stimulate investigation into gestational weight gain and post-partum losses in different ethnocultural contexts.(c) 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."

Trikalinos"", ""Joseph Lau""]"	"This article summarizes the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's evidence report on the effects of breastfeeding on term infant and maternal health outcomes in developed countries.Medline, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, bibliographies of selected reviews, and suggestions from domain experts were surveyed. Searches were limited to English-language publications.Eligible comparisons examined the association between differential exposure to breastfeeding and health outcomes. We assessed 15 infant and six maternal outcomes. For four outcomes, we also updated previously published systematic reviews. For the rest of the outcomes, we either summarized previous systematic reviews or conducted new systematic reviews; randomized and non-randomized comparative trials, prospective cohorts, and case-control studies were included. Adjusted estimates were extracted from non-experimental designs. The studies were graded for methodological quality. We did not draw conclusions from poor quality studies.We screened over 9,000 abstracts. Thirty-two primary studies on term infant health outcomes, 43 primary studies on maternal health outcomes, and 28 systematic reviews or meta-analyses that covered approximately 400 individual studies were included in this review. A history of breastfeeding was associated with a reduction in the risk of acute otitis media, nonspecific gastroenteritis, severe lower respiratory tract infections, atopic dermatitis, asthma (young children), obesity, type 1 and 2 diabetes, childhood leukemia, and sudden infant death syndrome. There was no relationship between breastfeeding in term infants and cognitive performance. There were insufficient good quality data to address the relationship between breastfeeding and cardiovascular diseases and infant mortality. For maternal outcomes, a history of lactation was associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, breast, and ovarian cancer. Early cessation of breastfeeding or no breastfeeding was associated with an increased risk of maternal postpartum depression. There was no relationship between a history of lactation and the risk of osteoporosis. The effect of breastfeeding in mothers on return-to-prepregnancy weight was negligible, and the effect of breastfeeding on postpartum weight loss was unclear.A history of breastfeeding is associated with a reduced risk of many diseases in infants and mothers. Future research would benefit from clearer selection criteria, definitions of breastfeeding exposure, and adjustment for potential confounders. Matched designs such as sibling analysis may provide a method to control for hereditary and household factors that are important in certain outcomes."

The case group consisted of 1,465, 133 and 99 women who had first been diagnosed as having breast, endometrial and ovarian cancer, respectively. The referents were 25,488 female first-visit outpatients who had not previously been diagnosed with any type of cancer. The odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were estimated using an unconditional logistic regression model. An inverse association with experience of delivery and a positive association with body mass index (BMI) and with change of BMI after 20 years of age, were observed consistently for all three cancer sites. We observed similar risk and protective factors for breast and endometrial cancer, but the effect of reproduction and overweight condition (BMI> or =25) were more prominent in endometrial cancer. Although the present study failed to find site-specific risk factors for ovarian cancer, the results provided evidence that being overweight and/or weight gain in adult life is a common risk factor for all three cancer sites.

Results indicate that the more complex measure has overall superior predictive accuracy, but its downside is that subjects exhibit noisier behavior. Our main result is that subjectsÕ numerical skills can help better assess this tradeoff: the simpler task may be preferred for subjects who exhibit low numeracy, as it generates less noisy behavior but similar predictive accuracy.

The argument is that, as rethoric, accounting must be understood as an attempt to convince some audience of the legitimacy of business ventures. Goody's analysis of writing and literacy is applied to the development of accounting as a technique. As a practical method, double-entry bookkeeping appears to have increased ""rationality,"" but the rhetorical side of double entry is also critical. The conclusion is that the significance of double-entry bookkeeping can be appreciated only if its rhetorical and technical aspects are considered."

The term genealogy conveys a focus on the outcomes of the past, rather than a quest for the origins of the present. It is intended to avoid an a priori limiting of the field of study to accounting as it currently exists, or to a particular accounting technique such as double-entry bookkeeping. And it entails an emphasis on the historical contingency of contemporary practices, a concern with the multiple and dispersed surfaces of emergence of disparate practices of economic calculation. Secondly, the paper emphasizes the discursive nature of calculation, the language and vocabularies in which a particular practice is articulated, the ideals attached to certain calculative technologies. Thirdly, the paper stresses the importance of attending to ensembles of practices and rationales that are assembled at various collective levels, rather than with isolated instances of this or that way of accounting. The delineation of the domain of traditional accounting history is illustrated by reference to three sets of issues: the links between double-entry bookkeeping and capitalism in the writings of Weber and Sombart; the links between bookkeeping practice and decision making in the writings of Yamey; and the quest for examples of Òearly management accountingÓ in the writings of those such as Edwards and Fleischman & Parker. In contrast to such concerns of accounting history, four genealogies are presented: the promotion of discounted cash-flow techniques for investment decisions in the U.K. in the 1960s; the emergence of costs in the late eighteenth century; the accounting for value added event in Britain in the late 1970s; and the construction of standard costing in the early decades of the twentieth century."

The archaeological record contains hundreds of situations in which societies developed long-term sustainable relationships with their environmentsÑand thousands in which the relationships were destructive. Charles Redman demonstrates that much can be learned from an improved understanding of peoples who, through seemingly rational decisions, degraded their environments and threatened their own survival. By discussing archaeological case studies from around the worldÑfrom the deforestation of the Mayan lowlands to soil erosion in ancient Greece to the almost total depletion of resources on Easter IslandÑRedman reveals the long-range coevolution of culture and environment and clearly shows the impact that ancient peoples had on their world. These case studies focus on four themes: habitat transformation and animal extinctions, agricultural practices, urban growth, and the forces that accompany complex society. They show that humankind's commitment to agriculture has had cultural consequences that have conditioned our perception of the environment and reveal that societies before European contact did not necessarily live the utopian existences that have been popularly supposed. Whereas most books on this topic tend to treat human societies as mere reactors to environmental stimuli, Redman's volume shows them to be active participants in complex and evolving ecological relationships. Human Impact on Ancient Environments demonstrates how archaeological research can provide unique insights into the nature of human stewardship of the Earth and can permanently alter the way we think about humans and the environment."

External pressures resulting in urban sprawl in the Stockholm metropolitan region increasingly challenge the capacity of the NUP to continue to generate valuable ecosystem services. Setting aside protected areas, without accounting for the role of human stewardship of the cultural landscape, will most likely fail. In a social inventory of the area, we identify 69 local user and interest groups currently involved in the NUP area. Of these, 25 are local stewardship associations that have a direct role in managing habitats within the park that sustain such services as recreational landscapes, seed dispersal, and pollination.

This paper discusses lessons for food security from historic and prehistoric cities. The Chicago school of urban sociology established a modernist understanding of urbanism as an essentialist reality separate from its larger life-support system. However, different urban histories have given rise to a remarkable spatial diversity and temporal variation viewed at the global and long-term scales that are often overlooked in urban scholarship. Drawing on two case studies from widely different historical and cultural contexts - the Classic Maya civilization of the late first millennium AD and Byzantine Constantinople - this paper demonstrates urban farming as a pertinent feature of urban support systems over the long-term and global scales. We show how urban gardens, agriculture, and water management as well as the linked social-ecological memories of how to uphold such practices over time have contributed to long-term food security during eras of energy scarcity. We exemplify with the function of such local blue-green infrastructures during chocks to urban supply lines. We conclude that agricultural production is not ""the antithesis of the city,"" but often an integrated urban activity that contribute to the resilience of cities."

For more than 2000 years the city and its inhabitants have endured numerous changes and crises. Plague, war and economic regression have at times reduced its population to only a fraction of the previous size. The city has been subject to numerous sieges, the longest lasting eight years! Conquered only once prior to the major transformation in 1453, the city flourished again after each crisis and today it is still an important centre in this part of the world, on the border between the Mediterranean and the Black Sea.  How could Constantinople maintain its leading position for such a long time, after suffering so many crises? In this chapter, the authors emphasize that the ability of a city to survive under stress has its fundamental origins in how the city was organized and maintained. Special focus is put on the organizational and ecosystem services aspects of urban agriculture in the city. The authors explore how the inhabitants of the ancient city of Constantinople managed to maintain a resilient food supply system. Constantinople differs in many ways from our modern cities, which are dependent on resources from a global hinterland that are transported using fossil fuels, and thus it can serve as an educational example for our time. At its first peak during the 6th century it was dependent on a complex grain transport system with ships travelling all the way to North Africa. This system collapsed in conjunction with the Arab expansion in the 7th century, and the collapse became a major part of a long recession that profoundly affected the city. That the city nonetheless survived cannot be explained by any single factor. The answer must be sought through a holistic perspective in which the variety of resource assets is seen as playing a major role. A particularly interesting aspect, related to today's global transport system, is the urban agriculture system within and just outside the city walls. The walls did not constitute the limits for a densely populated area. They rather delimited an area with dispersed ""sub-communities"" and numerous acres of, for example, orchards and vineyards. These areas could apparently sustain the population with a considerable amount of food and probably were important for the city's ability to withstand sieges and periods of food shortage. This system was continuous and was maintained by the inhabitants' living memory as well as by important institutions. In our society, where the supply of food is considered as something obvious, one can question whether we lack memory as well as preparations for similar crises despite the fact that the food supply crisis of the Second World War is only 65 years behind us.Urban mind"	"The most diffi cult blockade on the food supply lines, at the end of the fourteenth century AD, lasted an astonishing 8 years, but it did not succeed in starving out the urban population (#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2010 )."

Since the 1980s that view has been disputed, but the debate has remained unresolved because of insufficient data on the landscape beyond the great temples: the broader context of the monumental remains was only partially understood and had not been adequately mapped. Since the 1990s, French, Australian, and Cambodian teams have sought to address this empirical deficit through archaeological mapping projects by using traditional methods such as ground survey in conjunction with advanced radar remote-sensing applications in partnership with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)/Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). Here we present a major outcome of that research: a comprehensive archaeological map of greater Angkor, covering nearly 3,000 km2, prepared by the Greater Angkor Project (GAP).

Such concerns reflect the growing real-world limitations of traditional concepts of a simple rural-urban dichotomy. Moreover, recent archaeological research suggests that these phenomena may have ancient antecedents. Present-day fringes/interfaces have become intimately bound up with notions of (more) sustainable urbanization and urban development, with different issues and agendas manifested in different geohistorical zones of urbanization. Following an overview of planning issues in (post)industrial societies, the chapter addresses the complexities of changing peri-urban production and livelihood systems in the context of rapid urbanization in poorer countries, distinctive peri-urban challenges of appropriate and flexible planning and development, and the future prospects for enhanced sustainability in this most challenging category of development-environment interfaces.

This view is shared by many contemporary urban sociologists who claim that disparities in prosperity and shrinking regions have replaced the rural-urban continuum as the primary dimension of spatial inequality in Germany. According to Fischer's (1975) subcultural theory of urbanism, however, large cities will continue to produce and attract unconventional, nontraditional lifestyles due to a critical mass of like-minded people. In this paper, we test these hypotheses against rural-urban as well as regional variations in lifestyles using survey data randomly sampled from resident registration lists of rural and urban municipalities in four German states. As a measurement instrument we use Otte's (2004) lifestyle typology conceptualized along two dimensions: a level of living and a modernity/biographical perspective. Replicating it supra-regionally for the first time, we provide evidence of its reliability and construct validity, albeit with some reservations for East Germany. In essence, inhabitants of large cities prove to be more modern, biographically open, and unconventional; East Germans tend to have a reduced level of living - even when differences in social structural composition are controlled for"	"The idea of cities as separate entities essentially detached from their broader life-support systems (#AUTHOR_TAG 1938 ) was strongly linked to major innovations in transportation technology as Chicago became an important hub in the U.S. railroad network in the 1850s, and food transportation over great distances became possible."

Why should researchers in this area pay attention to ancient cities? After all, modern cities differ significantly from their premodern antecedents, and archaeological and historical data are very incomplete about key urban processes. Nevertheless, I suggest that ancient cities are relevant to research on contemporary urbanization in two realms: comparison and long-term change. A consideration of ancient cities, such as the pre-Aztec metropolis of Teotihuacan, Mexico (Figure 1) expands the sample of cities that scholars and policy-makers can draw on for comparative insights.1 Cities are complex phenomena, and a broader base for comparison reveals the patterns of variability among cities. A larger sample helps scholars to distinguish universal urban patterns from unique occurrences, and general trends from idiosyncratic events.

Why do well-intentioned plans for improving the human condition go tragically awry? In this wide-ranging and original book, James C. Scott analyzes failed cases of large-scale authoritarian plans in a variety of fields. Centrally managed social plans misfire, Scott argues, when they impose schematic visions that do violence to complex interdependencies that are notÑand cannotÑbe fully understood. Further, the success of designs for social organization depends upon the recognition that local, practical knowledge is as important as formal, epistemic knowledge. The author builds a persuasive case against Òdevelopment theoryÓ and imperialistic state planning that disregards the values, desires, and objections of its subjects. He identifies and discusses four conditions common to all planning disasters: administrative ordering of nature and society by the state; a Òhigh-modernist ideologyÓ that places confidence in the ability of science to improve every aspect of human life; a willingness to use authoritarian state power to effect large- scale interventions; and a prostrate civil society that cannot effectively resist such plans."

This problem arises more specifically in evaluating the impacts of various policies that are proposed to promote Ôsustainable developmentÕ, because the temporal horizon of sustainability analysis is multi-generational. Sustainable development involves three hierarchically inter-related problems. These are maintaining (1) a sustainable scale of the economy relative to its ecological life support system; (2) a fair distribution of resources and opportunities, not only among members of the current generation of humans, but also among present and future generations (and even in some formulations among humans and other species); and (3) an efficient allocation of resources over time that adequately accounts for natural capital (Daly, 1990). Over generations, the economy is expected to grow significantly in its material scale as a result of population growth and probably also as a result of the increasing expectations of consumers. As the scale of economic activity increases there is also, in general, an increase in the impacts of economic activity on the environment. This focuses attention on both population growth and the material consumption levels of advanced societies. In this paper the focus is on the material consumption vector, questioning whether there may be a social interest in influencing individual preferences toward less material consumption-oriented forms of satisfaction."

Here we develop spatially explicit probabilistic forecasts of global urban land-cover change and explore the direct impacts on biodiversity hotspots and tropical carbon biomass. If current trends in population density continue and all areas with high probabilities of urban expansion undergo change, then by 2030, urban land cover will increase by 1.2 million km(2), nearly tripling the global urban land area circa 2000. This increase would result in considerable loss of habitats in key biodiversity hotspots, with the highest rates of forecasted urban growth to take place in regions that were relatively undisturbed by urban development in 2000: the Eastern Afromontane, the Guinean Forests of West Africa, and the Western Ghats and Sri Lanka hotspots. Within the pan-tropics, loss in vegetation biomass from areas with high probability of urban expansion is estimated to be 1.38 PgC (0.05 PgC yr(-1)), equal to ~5% of emissions from tropical deforestation and land-use change.

Advanced communication and transport technologies allow food sequestration from the farthest reaches of the planet, but have markedly increasing urban dependence on global food systems over the past 50 years. Simultaneously, such advances have eroded collective memory of food production, while suitable spaces for urban gardening have been lost. These factors combine to heighten the potential for food shortages when--as occurred in the 20th century-- major economic, political or environmental crises sever supply lines to urban areas. This paper considers how to govern urban areas sustainably in order to ensure food security in times of crisis by: evincing the effectiveness of urban gardening during crises; showing how allotment gardens serve as conduits for transmitting collective social-ecological memories of food production; and, discussing roles and strategies of urban environmental movements for protecting urban green space. Urban gardening and urban social movements can build local ecological and social response capacity against major collapses in urban food supplies. Hence, they should be incorporated as central elements of sustainable urban development. Urban governance for resilience should be historically informed about major food crises and allow for redundant food production solutions as a response to uncertain futures.SUPER, ''Sustainable Urban Planning for Ecosystem Services and Resilience"	"However, clear delineations between urban and rural areas and use of urban green spaces for purely recreational purposes did not emerge until the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and were reinforced by the development of a globalized economy, the fossil fuel energy regime, and technological innovations such as the steam engine and the railway (McNeill 2000 ;Barthel and Isendahl 2012 ;#AUTHOR_TAG et al. 2013 )."

Gordon Childe lays out his theory about how cities first arose and continually developed throughout history in a long process of slow growth punctuated by periods of dramatic change that he termed Òrevolutions.Ó Before the first cities arose in antiquity, humankind lived for millennia in Paleolithic, hunter-gatherer bands. Then, perhaps 20,000-30,000 years BCE, the ÒAgricultural RevolutionÓ ushered in an age of Neolithic settled farming communities, and this was in turn followed by the ÒUrban RevolutionÓ as, around 5,000-6,000 years BCE, new, highly developed societies arose. These first cities established the idea of the state in the institutions of kingship and priesthood, saw the emergence of specialized occupations and social classes, invented systems of record-keeping that became writing, and built strong defensive walls to protect the city residents from enemies, monumental palaces and temples for the urban overlords, and vast irrigation systems to increase and control agricultural production. Writing in the 1940s and 1950s and strongly influenced my Marxist thought, Childe argued that the most recent human revolution was the ÒIndustrial RevolutionÓ which created the modern world and a period of unfolding technological and socio-political progress."

Simple, deterministic relationships between environmental stress and social change are inadequate. Extreme drought, for instance, triggered both social collapse and ingenious management of water through irrigation. Human responses to change, in turn, feed into climate and ecological systems, producing a complex web of multidirectional connections in time and space. Integrated records of the co-evolving human-environment system over millennia are needed to provide a basis for a deeper understanding of the present and for forecasting the future. This requires the major task of assembling and integrating regional and global historical, archaeological, and paleoenvironmental records. Humans cannot predict the future. But, if we can adequately understand the past, we can use that understanding to influence our decisions and to create a better, more sustainable and desirable future."

CCT666	81074389	History of Urbanization and the Missing Ecology	Thomas Elmqvist	Origins of the Maya Forest Garden: Maya Resource Management	"[""Anabel Ford"", ""Ronald Nigh""]"	"Abstract There is growing interest in the ecology of the Maya Forest past, present, and future, as well as in the role of humans in the transformation of this ecosystem. In this paper, we bring together and re-evaluate paleoenvironmental, ethnobiological, and archaeological data to reconstruct the related effects of climatic shifts and human adaptations to and alterations of the lowland Maya Forest. In particular, we consider the paleoenvironmental data from the Maya Forest area in light of interpretations of the precipitation record from the Cariaco Basin. During the Archaic period, a time of stable climatic conditions 8,000-4,000 years ago, we propose that the ancestral Maya established an intimate relationship with an expanding tropical forest, modifying the landscape to meet their subsistence needs. We propose that the succeeding period of climatic chaos during the Preclassic period, 4,000-1,750 years ago, provoked the adaptation to settled agrarian life. This new adaptation, we suggest, was based on a resource management strategy that grew out of earlier landscape modification practices. Eventually, this resulted in a highly managed landscape that we call the Maya Forest Garden. This highly productive and sustainable system of resource management formed the foundation for the development of the Maya civilization, from 3,000 to 1,000 years ago, and was intensified during the latter millennia of a stable climatic regime as population grew and the civilization developed. These strategies of living in the forest evolved into the milpa cycle--the axis of the Maya Forest garden resource management system that created the extraordinary economic value recognized in the Maya Forest today."

After the internodes elongated and the crops became dense, the changes in numbers of Sporobolomyces were similar in all three crops; leaves produced few colonies until they had lived half their lives, when the number of colonies progressively increased, to reach a maximum after the leaves died. Before the internodes elongated and the crop was still sparse, winter-sown wheat also produced colonies on living leaves, but colonies occurred only on dead leaves in still sparse spring-sown wheat and barley. Dead leaves in summer had three times as many colonies per unit area as dead leaves in winter. The upper and lower surfaces of ageing leaves carried equal numbers of colonies, but the distal parts carried more than the proximal. The number of colonies seemed to be correlated with a high humidity that enables Sporobolomyces to spread and, perhaps, with exudations from ageing leaves of substances that encourage its growth. The occurrence of Sporobolomyces colonies seemed not to influence the development of leaf parasites or to be influenced by them, but Tilletiopsis, another innocuous fungus that occurred only in July and August, greatly decreased the number of colonies of Sporobolomyces, particularly on the spring-sown barley. In addition Cladosporium was regularly isolated from dead leaves, more abundantly during summer than winter, and Buttera sporadically. It is suggested that, as with roots and the ÔrhizosphereÕ, leaves have a ÔphyllosphereÕ, with a characteristic micro-flora that may contain many species. Twenty isolates of Sporobolomyces and ten of Tilletiopsis were identified as Sporobolomyces roseus Kluy. et van Niel and Tilletiopsis minor Nyland, respectively.

The aim to preserve quantitative relationships between genotypes through PCR places new demands on primers to accurately match target sites and provide short amplicons. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the ribosome encoding genes is a commonly used marker for many fungal groups. Here, we describe three new primers - fITS7, gITS7 and fITS9, which may be used to amplify the fungal ITS2 region by targeting sites in the 5.8S encoding gene. We evaluated the primers and compared their performance with the commonly used ITS1f primer by 454-sequencing of both artificially assembled templates and field samples. When the entire ITS region was amplified using the ITS1f/ITS4 primer combination, we found strong bias against species with longer amplicons. This problem could be overcome by using the new primers, which produce shorter amplicons and better preserve the quantitative composition of the template.

Maris Huntsman in 1981 and 1982 were colonised by a variety of micro-organisms whose numbers increased rapidly between anthesis and harvest. The predominant mycoflora were yeasts, yeast-like fungi and filamentous fungi which included Cladosporium spp., Verticillium lecanii, Alternaria alternata, Fusarium spp. and Epicoccum nigrum. Although similar species were isolated, their relative abundance on flag leaves and ears differed. The fungicide captafol was most effective as a protectant and significantly decreased populations of fungi on flag leaves and ears for 6 and 4 wk respectively, compared to untreated controls. Benomyl and Delsene M (carbendazim + maneb) were the most effective of the systemic sprays and formulations. In general, fungicides affected populations of yeasts, yeast-like fungi and Cladosporium spp. most while Alternaria was tolerant of all treatments. Yields of winter wheat were increased in two seasons by an average 0-2 t ha-1 (2-4%) following a single late fungicide treatment at G.S. 50 or 60 and 0-41 t ha-1 (5-1%) when this was combined with an early spray against foliar diseases (G.S. 38-40). Individual treatments increased yield by up to 12% with little difference between applications at G.S. 50 or 60. The yield benefit came mainly from increased 1000-grain weights.

Fungicides like dithiocarbamates, captafol, benzimidazoles and tridemorph reduce the saprophytic microflora, while others have little or no effect. The fungicides are mostly effective for 2-3 weeks after the treatment. When evaluating the consequences of a disturbance of the microbial balance we should realize that the saprophytes are able to antagonize a number of necrotrophic pathogens of cereal leaves and ears (Cochliobolus sativus, Septoria nodorum, Fusarium culmorum, Pseudocercosporella herpotrichoides, Colletotrichum graminicola). This antagonism is based on nutrient competition, which reduces the superficial development of the pathogen before penetration, resulting in a reduction of infection of about 50 % or more. This interaction seems particularly important when saprophytes compete successfully for extraneous nutrients from pollen grains or aphid honeydew, which will otherwise stimulate infection."

As only a small fraction of the fungi present in soil can be cultured, conventional microbiological techniques yield only limited information on the composition and dynamics of fungal communities in soil. DNA-based methods do not depend on the culturability of microorganisms, and therefore they offer an attractive alternative for the study of complex fungal community structures. For this purpose, we designed various PCR primers that allow the specific amplification of fungal 18S-ribosomal-DNA (rDNA) sequences, even in the presence of nonfungal 18S rDNA. DNA was extracted from the wheat rhizosphere, and 18S rDNA gene banks were constructed in Escherichia coli by cloning PCR products generated with primer pairs EF4-EF3 (1. 4 kb) and EF4-fung5 (0.5 kb). Fragments of 0.5 kb from the cloned inserts were sequenced and compared to known rDNA sequences. Sequences from all major fungal taxa were amplified by using both primer pairs. As predicted by computer analysis, primer pair EF4-EF3 appeared slightly biased to amplify Basidiomycota and Zygomycota, whereas EF4-fung5 amplified mainly Ascomycota. The 61 clones that were sequenced matched the sequences of 24 different species in the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) database. Similarity values ranged from 0.676 to 1. Temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE) analysis of the fungal community in the wheat rhizosphere of a microcosm experiment was carried out after amplification of total DNA with both primer pairs. This resulted in reproducible, distinctive fingerprints, confirming the difference in amplification specificity. Clear banding patterns were obtained with soil and rhizosphere samples by using both primer sets in combination. By comparing the electrophoretic mobility of community fingerprint bands to that of the bands obtained with separate clones, some could be tentatively identified. While 18S-rDNA sequences do not always provide the taxonomic resolution to identify fungal species and strains, they do provide information on the diversity and dynamics of groups of related species in environmental samples with sufficient resolution to produce discrete bands which can be separated by TGGE. This combination of 18S-rDNA PCR amplification and TGGE community analysis should allow study of the diversity, composition, and dynamics of the fungal community in bulk soil and in the rhizosphere."

We investigated whether the genotype of the host tree influences community structure of foliar fungi. We sampled leaves from genotyped balsam poplars from across the species' range, and applied 454 amplicon sequencing to characterize foliar fungal communities. At the time of the sampling the poplars had been growing in a common garden for two years. We found diverse fungal communities associated with the poplar leaves. Linear discriminant analysis and generalized linear models showed that host genotypes had a structuring effect on the composition of foliar fungal communities. The observed patterns may be explained by a filtering mechanism which allows the trees to selectively recruit fungal strains from the environment. Alternatively, host genotype-specific fungal communities may be present in the tree systemically, and persist in the host even after two clonal reproductions. Both scenarios are consistent with host tree adaptation to specific foliar fungal communities and suggest that there is a functional basis for the strong biotic interaction."

In recent years seed has become an international commodity used to exchange germplasm around the world. Seed is, however, also an efficient means of introducing plant pathogens into a new area as well as providing a means of their survival from one cropping season to another.  Seed borne mycroflora are significant destroyers of food stuffs and grains during storage rendering them unfit for human consumption by retarding their nutritive value and often by producing mycotoxins. Seed-borne pathogens have been involved in seed rots during germination and seedling mortality leading to poor crop stand reduction in plant growth and productivity of crops. The seed-borne pathogens associated with seeds externally or internally may cause seed abortion, seed rot, seed necrosis, reduction or elimination of germination capacity, as well as seedling damage resulting in development of disease at later stages of plant growth by systemic or local infection. Infected seeds play considerable role in the establishment of economically important plant diseases in the field resulting in heavy reduction of crop yields.

Under its hegemony, language learners have been led to believe that language is a set of transactions, which they need to master in order to meet exam requirements/ academic standards. Such a belief has precluded our students from looking at language learning as a life-long educational endeavour and as an instrument of constructive social change/empowerment. The course-book drills neither provide frameworks for the learners to have an emotional engagement with the language nor nourish their capacity for imaginative and expressive use of language. Consequently, the students are subject to an educationally unrewarding language learning experience, which denies them of agency and voice. In light of this educational malaise, the use of imaginative content becomes an urgent educational priority in the language classroom. The prevalence of imaginative content in the language classroom can lay the groundwork for personal and social construction of meanings by the students.

Such forecasting can be achieved by adopting time series forecasting methods, such as the classical Holt-Winters (HW) that is quite popular for seasonal series. An alternative forecasting approach comes from the use of more flexible learning algorithms, such as Neural Networks (NN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). This paper presents a simultaneous variable (i.e. time lag) and model selection algorithm for multi-step ahead forecasting using NN and SVM.

Recently, the use of time series features for forecast model averaging has been an emerging research focus in the forecasting community. Nonetheless, most of the existing approaches depend on the manual choice of an appropriate set of features. Exploiting machine learning methods to extract features from time series automatically becomes crucial in state-of-the-art time series analysis. In this paper, we introduce an automated approach to extract time series features based on time series imaging. We first transform time series into recurrence plots, from which local features can be extracted using computer vision algorithms. The extracted features are used for forecast model averaging. Our experiments show that forecasting based on automatically extracted features, with less human intervention and a more comprehensive view of the raw time series data, yields highly comparable performances with the best methods in the largest forecasting competition dataset (M4) and outperforms the top methods in the Tourism forecasting competition dataset"	"In particular, multi-step ahead predictions (e.g., issued several months in advance) are useful to aid tactical decisions, such as planning production resources or evaluating alternative economic strategies #AUTHOR_TAG."

Two separate but interrelated lines of argument are developed. One is that the leading evidence-based theory of the maintenance of eating disorders, the cognitive behavioural theory of bulimia nervosa, should be extended in its focus to embrace four additional maintaining mechanisms. Specifically, we propose that in certain patients one or more of four additional maintaining processes interact with the core eating disorder maintaining mechanisms and that when this occurs it is an obstacle to change. The additional maintaining processes concern the influence of clinical perfectionism, core low self-esteem, mood intolerance and interpersonal difficulties. The second line of argument is that in the case of eating disorders shared, but distinctive, clinical features tend to be maintained by similar psychopathological processes. Accordingly, we suggest that common mechanisms are involved in the persistence of bulimia nervosa, anorexia nervosa and the atypical eating disorders. Together, these two lines of argument lead us to propose a new transdiagnostic theory of the maintenance of the full range of eating disorders, a theory which embraces a broader range of maintaining mechanisms than the current theory concerning bulimia nervosa. In the final sections of the paper we describe a transdiagnostic treatment derived from the new theory, and we consider in principle the broader relevance of transdiagnostic theories of maintenance."

Although not all expected associations for the maintenance variables were significant, overall the validity of the model was supported. Concern about shape and weight directly led to exercise behaviors. There was a direct path from binge eating to exercise and other forms of compensatory behaviors (i.e., purging); but no significant path from restriction to binge eating.

The aim of the present study was to compare CBT-E with interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT), a leading alternative treatment for adults with an eating disorder. One hundred and thirty patients with any form of eating disorder (body mass index >17.5 to <40.0) were randomized to either CBT-E or IPT. Both treatments involved 20 sessions over 20 weeks followed by a 60-week closed follow-up period. Outcome was measured by independent blinded assessors. Twenty-nine participants (22.3%) did not complete treatment or were withdrawn. At post-treatment 65.5% of the CBT-E participants met criteria for remission compared with 33.3% of the IPT participants (p < 0.001). Over follow-up the proportion of participants meeting criteria for remission increased, particularly in the IPT condition, but the CBT-E remission rate remained higher (CBT-E 69.4%, IPT 49.0%; p = 0.028). The response to CBT-E was very similar to that observed in an earlier study. The findings indicate that CBT-E is potent treatment for the majority of outpatients with an eating disorder.

The second is an empirical study which explores the experience of binge eating and loss of control for individuals with BN. Five women with BN were interviewed. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis was used to analyse the data and five themes emerged.

Van Strien et al. (2005) extended the negative affect pathway of the original dual pathway model by adding two additional intervening variables: interoceptive deficits and emotional eating. The purpose of this study was to test and compare the original and extended model using prospective data. Both types of loss of control over eating (i.e., subjective and objective binge eating) were evaluated. Data collected from 361 adolescent girls, who were interviewed and completed self-report measures annually over a 2-year period, were analysed using structural equation modeling. Although both models provided a good fit to the data, the extended model fit the adolescent girls' sample data better and accounted for a greater proportion of variance in binge eating than the original model. All proposed mediational pathways of both models were supported and all indirect effects examined through bootstrap procedure were significant. Although our results confirmed the validity of both models and extended previous findings to an early- to middle adolescent group, the bi-directional relationship between dietary restriction and negative affect suggests that the association between these key risk factors for binge eating are more complex than outlined in both the original and extended dual-pathway models.

Several of the proposed changes, including according formal diagnostic status to binge eating disorder (BED), removing the separation of bulimia nervosa (BN) into purging and non-purging subtypes, and reducing the binge frequency threshold from twice per week to once per week for both BN and (BED), have considerable empirical evidence to support them and will likely have the effect of facilitating clinical practice, improving access to care, improving public and professional awareness and understanding of these disorders and stimulating the additional research needed to address at least some problematic issues. However, the omission of any reference to variants of BN characterized by subjective, but not objective, binge eating episodes, and to the undue influence of weight or shape on self-evaluation or similar cognitive criterion in relation to the diagnosis of BED, is regrettable, given their potential to inform clinical and research practice and given that there is considerable evidence to support specific reference to these distinctions. Other aspects of the proposed criteria, such as retention of behavioral indicators of impaired control associated with binge eating and the presence of marked distress regarding binge eating among the diagnostic for BED, appear anomalous in that there is little or no evidence to support their validity or clinical utility.

We aimed to assess the temporal relation among stressful events, negative affect, and bulimic events in the natural environment using ecological momentary assessment. Method: A total of 133 women with current BN recorded their mood, eating behavior, and the occurrence of stressful events every day for 2 weeks. Multilevel structural equation mediation models evaluated the relations among Time 1 stress measures (i.e., interpersonal stressors, work/environment stressors, general daily hassles, and stress appraisal), Time 2 negative affect, and Time 2 binge eating and purging, controlling for Time 1 negative affect. Results: Increases in negative affect from Time 1 to Time 2 significantly mediated the relations between Time 1 interpersonal stressors, work/environment stressors, general daily hassles, and stress appraisal and Time 2 binge eating and purging. When modeled simultaneously, confidence intervals for interpersonal stressors, general daily hassles, and stress appraisal did not overlap, suggesting that each had a distinct impact on negative affect in relation to binge eating and purging. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that stress precedes the occurrence of bulimic behaviors and that increases in negative affect following stressful events mediate this relation. Results suggest that stress and subsequent negative affect may function as maintenance factors for bulimic behaviors and should be targeted in treatment."

The present study is designed to repeat this important comparison.Two hundred twenty patients meeting DSM-III-R criteria for bulimia nervosa were allocated at random to 19 sessions of either CBT or IPT conducted over a 20-week period and evaluated for 1 year after treatment in a multisite study.Cognitive-behavioral therapy was significantly superior to IPT at the end of treatment in the percentage of participants recovered (29% [n=32] vs 6% [n=71), the percentage remitted (48% [n=53] vs 28% [n = 31]), and the percentage meeting community norms for eating attitudes and behaviors (41% [n=45] vs 27% [n=30]). For treatment completers, the percentage recovered was 45% (n= 29) for CBT and 8% (n= 5) for IPT. However, at follow-up, there were no significant differences between the 2 treatments: 26 (40%) CBT completers had recovered at follow-up compared with 17 (27%) IPT completers.Cognitive-behavioral therapy was significantly more rapid in engendering improvement in patients with bulimia nervosa than IPT.

CCT753	30708902	Testing the cognitive-behavioural maintenance models across DSM-5 bulimic-type eating disorder diagnostic groups: a multi-centre study	Antonios Dakanalis	Eating disorders guidelines from NICE	"[""G Terence Wilson"", ""Roz Shafran""]"	"Context: January, 2004, marked the publication of NICE guidelines for the treatment of eating disorders, a series of recommendations from a multidisciplinary, comprehensive, and rigorous process. The recommendations are assigned a grade from A (strong empirical support from well-conducted randomised trials) to C (expert opinion without strong empirical data). Over 100 recommendations were made, most of which were given a C grade. No specific recommendations were made for anorexia nervosa. Cognitive behavioural therapy for bulimia nervosa was assigned grade A because of the evidence showing that it is superior to other psychological and drug treatments. Antidepressants for bulimia nervosa were given grade B. No specific recommendations were made for atypical eating disorders except for binge-eating disorder (cognitive behavioural therapy was recommended [A]). Starting point: The methodological rigour of the NICE guidelines is in contrast with the current Practice Guideline for Eating Disorders (PGED) of the American Psychiatric Association. PGED does not detail criteria for evaluating supporting research. Instead of making clear recommendations, PGED is uncritically inclusive and emphasises subjective judgment of individual clinicians. The NICE guidelines balance recommending specific treatments against the importance of clinical judgment when guideline recommendations are not readily applicable. Where next: Evidence-based guidelines are limited by the quality of the available research and its clinical relevance. The NICE guidelines underscore the absence of sufficient evidence for guidance in several important areas, such as atypical eating disorders (eating disorders not otherwise specified) which are the most common. Research on the treatment of these atypical eating disorders is needed. Evidence-based psychological treatments are not routinely implemented in general practice. Dissemination of these demonstrably effective treatments poses a challenge, and learning how to implement evidence-based psychological treatments and monitor their use is a research priority."

Tuschen-Caffier""]"	"Current theories and nosology assume that the self-evaluation (SE) of individuals with eating disorders (EDs) is unduly influenced by body shape and weight. However, experimental data supporting this link are scarce, and it is not specified which subdomains of SE might be affected.We studied patients with anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN) and healthy controls (HC) with an affective priming (AP) procedure (Study 1) to unveil explicit and implicit associations between shape/weight and SE. We used weight/shape-related prime sentences, complemented by affectively congruent and incongruent target words from two SE domains. AP effects were assessed by event-related potentials (ERPs), reaction times (RTs) and subjective ratings. The ratings were also assessed (Study 2) in undergraduate restrained (RES) and unrestrained eaters (UNRES).Study 1 demonstrated stronger AP effects in both ED groups compared to HC on RTs and subjective ratings. ERPs showed AP effects only in the BN group. Restrained eaters showed similar, albeit less pronounced, priming effects on subjective ratings.ED patients associate shape/weight concerns with the non-appearance-related SE domains of interpersonal relationships and achievement/performance. These associations seem to be encoded deeper in BN patients relative to the other groups. Links between shape/weight and SE explain how body dissatisfaction impacts on self-esteem and mood in ED. The existence of similar associations in restrained eaters supports a continuum model according to which increasing associations between shape/weight and SE go along with increasing levels of ED symptoms."

This study compares the impact of applying the revised diagnostic criteria proposed by the DSM-5 workgroup, and the broad categories for the diagnosis of eating disorders (BCD-ED) proposed by Walsh and Sysko on the prevalence of EDNOS.In two nationwide epidemiological studies the prevalence of eating disorders among female high school (n = 2,028) and university students (n = 1,020) was examined using DSM-IV criteria. We used a two-stage design, administering a questionnaire in the first stage and an interview in the second stage.In the combined samples 118 cases of eating disorders (DSM-IV) were detected, of which 86 were diagnosed as EDNOS (72.9%). Application of the DSM-5 criteria reduced the number of EDNOS cases to 60 (50.8%) or to 52 (44%), when using a BMI <18.5 as cutoff for ""significantly low weight"" criterion in AN; with the use of BCD-ED criteria, only 5 (4.2%) cases of EDNOS remained.Proposed criteria set for DSM-5 substantially reduce the number of EDNOS cases.

CCT767	81896289	Systemic Risk in the Financial Sector: An Analysis of the Subprime-Mortgage Financial Crisis	Martin Hellwig	Financial deregulation in Sweden	"[""Peter Englund""]"	"This article presents the following model of two regulatory classes of financial institutions interacting in financial and political markets to spur deregulation and riskier lending and investment, which in turn contributes to the severity of a financial crisis: 1) Regulation creates two categories of financial institutions. The first class faces greater restrictions in lending or investment activities but enjoys regulatory subsidies, such as an explicit or implicit government guarantee, while the second class is more loosely regulated and can make riskier loans or investments and earn additional profits. 2) These additional profits leads to calls for deregulation to enable the first class to participate in lucrative lending or investment markets. 3) Deregulation allows the first class of institution either to compete with the second class in formerly restricted markets or to invest in the second class, in either case, while retaining its regulatory subsidy. 4) Deregulation spurs additional lending in two ways: i) subsidy leakage, which occurs when the first class can use subsidized funds to make riskier investments (including investments in the second class) without regulation compensating for moral hazard; and ii) displacement, which occurs when subsidized competition pushes the second class into riskier market segments. 5) Additional lending increases leverage in the financial system and fuels a boom in an asset market. 6) Asset prices collapse and threaten the solvency of financial institutions. This model explains financial deregulation in Sweden in the 1980s, which led to a 1990 bank crisis. The model also provides a framework for scholars to examine whether deregulation in the United States involving the following dual classes of institutions contributed to the current crisis: GSEs (Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae) and sponsors of private label\u27 mortgage-backed securities; Commercial and investment banks with respect to the Glass-Steagall repeal; and Banks and hedge funds with respect to OTC derivatives.

Complete immunization against interest rate risk is shown to be undesirable as it precludes the exploitation of favourable reinvestment opportunities. Under the assumptions of Diamond-Dybvig (1983), interest-induced valuation risks of long-term assets should be born by early withdrawers, reinvestment opportunity risks of short-term assets by late withdrawers. Efficient liquidity provision thus entails no shifting of interest rate risk. In the absence of additional moral hazard, second-best allocations can be implemented through unregulated competition among banks."	"Thus, in the context of a model in which investors do not know beforehand when they will want to consume, #AUTHOR_TAG (1994a) shows that it is optimal to have an arrangement where people stipulate the amounts of short-term and long-term assets that they want to hold, with the proviso that, if they find that they want to consume early, they should bear the interest-induced valuation risk of long-term investments, and, if they want to consume late, they should bear the interest-induced reinvestment risk of short-term investments."	"['In principle, shifting this risk away from the originating institution and its debtor makes sense because there are other market participants who are better able to bear this risk.', 'Some market participants actually have long investment horizons and therefore do not consider the interest risk of real-estate finance to be a risk at all.', 'Thus, an insurance company or a pension fund has liabilities with maturities of twenty years or more, not too far removed from the economic life of a real-estate investment or the maturity of a mortgage instrument.', ""If such an institution invests in a long-term fixed-rate instrument, i.e., a mortgage or a mortgage-backed security, the question of how the market values this instrument at intervening dates is irrelevant because there is no point in liquidating this investment anyway and the institution's ability to fulfil its obligation to its own financiers depends on the returns from the security rather than the market's assessment."", 'Indeed, for an insurance company or pension fund, a fall in the value of long-term securities that is induced by an increase in interest rates tends to be unproblematic.', 'The very increase in interest rates provides the institution with scope to earn higher returns on new investments and thereby to better fulfil its obligations to its insurance and pension customers. 16', 'ven if one cannot a priori distinguish between short-term and long-term investors, the securitization of long-term investments can still make economic sense.', 'Thus, in the context of a model in which investors do not know beforehand when they will want to consume, #AUTHOR_TAG (1994a) shows that it is optimal to have an arrangement where people stipulate the amounts of short-term and long-term assets that they want to hold, with the proviso that, if they find that they want to consume early, they should bear the interest-induced valuation risk of long-term investments, and, if they want to consume late, they should bear the interest-induced reinvestment risk of short-term investments.', 'All risks that are associated with changes in interest rates should thus be shifted to final investors.', 'Securitization provides one way to achieve this.']"	5

Hellwig""]"	"Increased regulatory competition has sharpened the comparative awareness of advantages or disadvantages of different national models of political economy, economic organization, governance and regulation. Although institutional change is slow and subject to functional complementarities as well as social and cultural entrenchment, at least some features of successful modern market economies have been in the process of converging over the last decades. The most important change is a shift in governance from state to the market. As bureaucratic ex-ante control is replaced by judicial ex-post control, administrative discretion is replaced by the rule of law as guidelines for the economy. Furthermore, at least to some extent, public enforcement is being reduced in favor of private enforcement by way of disclosure, enhanced liability, and correspondent litigation for damages. Corporatist approaches to governance are giving way to market approaches, and outsider and market-oriented corporate governance models seem to be replacing insider-based regimes. This transition is far from smooth and poses a daunting challenge to regulators and academics trying to redefine the fundamental governance and regulatory setting. They are confronted with the task of making or keeping the national regulatory structure attractive to investors in the face of competitive pressures from other jurisdictions to adopt state-of-the-art solutions. At the same time, however, they must establish a coherent institutional framework that accommodates the efficient, modern rules with the existing and hard-to-change institutional setting. These challenges - put in a comparative and interdisciplinary perspective - are the subject of the book. As a reflection of the transnationality of the issues addressed, the world's three leading economies and their legal systems are included on an equal basis: the EU, the U.S., and Japan across each of the subtopics of corporations, bureaucracy and regulation, markets, and intermediaries.

The Role of Housing and Financial Wealth	"[""Jiri Slacalek""]"	"I investigate the effect of wealth on consumption in a new dataset with financial and housing wealth from 16 countries. The baseline estimation method based on the sluggishness of consumption growth implies that the eventual (long-run) marginal propensity to consume out of total wealth is 5 cents (averaged across countries). While the wealth effects are quite strong--between 4 and 6 cents--in countries with more developed mortgage markets and in market-based, Anglo-Saxon and non euro area economies, consumption only barely reacts to wealth elsewhere. The effect of housing wealth is somewhat smaller than that of financial wealth for most countries, but not for the U.S. and the UK. The housing wealth effect has risen substantially after 1988 as it has become easier to borrow against housing wealth."	73 Comparisons are made on the basis of numbers given in International Monetary Fund (2007) and #AUTHOR_TAG (2006).	"['As mentioned in the introduction, the IMF estimates that the total volume of non-prime mortgage-backed securities in the United States amounts to some 1.1 trillion dollars. 72', 'In absolute terms, this is a large number.', 'However, this number amounts to less than one fifth of the value of all residential mortgage-backed securities in the United States (5.6 trillion dollars), less than one tenth of the value of all residential mortgages in the United States (13 trillion dollars), less than one twentieth of the value of residential real estate in the United States (20-30 trillion dollars), and presumably less than one fortieth of the value of total private wealth in the United States. 73', 'ore to the point, the estimated 500 billion dollars of losses in non-prime mortgage-backed securities are much smaller than stock market losses after the burst of the technology bubble in 2000; 74 they are also smaller than the 71 International Monetary Fund (2007, p. 7).', 'In a similar vein, the 2006/2007 Annual Report of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), published in June 2007, mentions the subprime mortgage crisis as a threat for financial stability, without, however, conveying any sense of urgency.', 'In late June, at the 6th Annual BIS Conference, on ""Financial System and Macroeconomic Resilience"", nobody, myself included, seems to have had an inkling of the crisis that was about to unfold.', '72 The April 2007 Global Financial Stability Report of the IMF gave an estimate of 824 billion dollars of subprime mortgage-backed securities; I cannot tell whether the difference between the more recent estimates and this one is due to growth in 2007 or to the inclusion of Alt-A along with subprime mortgage-backed securities.', '73 Comparisons are made on the basis of numbers given in International Monetary Fund (2007) and #AUTHOR_TAG (2006).', '74 For US stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange alone, stock market capitalization declined from 11.5 trillion dollars at the end of 1999 and at the end of 2000 to 11.0 trillion dollars at the end of 2001 and to 9.0 trillion dollars at the end of 2002; for US stocks traded on NASDAQ, the decline went from 5.2 trillion dollars at the end of 1999 to 3.6 trillion dollars at the end of 2000, 2.7 trillion dollars at the end of 2001, and 2.0 trillion dollars at the end of 2002.', 'Data are taken from the World Federation of Exchanges at 600-800 billion dollars of losses that, at the peak of the S&L crisis around 1990, were guesstimated as losses of the US savings and loans industry.', 'Yet, the effects of the burst of the stock market bubble and of the S&L crisis on the global financial system were rather more limited; in the case of the S&L crisis, these effects were hardly noticeable.', 'Why then has the impact of the subprime mortgage crisis on the rest of the financial system been so much more severe?']"	0

The question investigated in this paper is how vulnerable do thrifts remain to an interest rate experience like that which triggered the 1980s S&L debacle? The short answer is that thrifts are even more vulnerable in 1989 than they were in 1977. The dollar volume of fixed-rate mortgages funded by short-term deposits in 1989, $400 billion, is slightly greater now than it was in 1977, and thrifts have also put over $325 billion of adjustable-rate loans with rate caps on their balance sheets. A sharp rise in interest rates (the one-year Treasury rate rose by 9 percentage points between 1977 and 1981) would cause significant losses on these capped loans, as well as on the fixed-rate loans."

Diamond""]"	"This paper develops a theory of financial intermediation based on minimizing the cost of monitoring information which is useful for resolving incentive problems between borrowers and lenders. It presents a characterization of the costs of providing incentives for delegated monitoring by a financial intermediary. Diversification within an intermediary serves to reduce these costs, even in a risk neutral economy. The paper presents some more general analysis of the effect of diversification on resolving incentive problems. In the environment assumed in the model, debt contracts with costly bankruptcy are shown to be optimal. The analysis has implications for the portfolio structure and capital structure of intermediaries"	"In the theory of financial institutions, therefore, the paradigmatic model of viable financial intermediation, due to #AUTHOR_TAG (1984), postulates an intermediary holding a fully diversified portfolio of assets, with outside finance taking entirely the form of debt, with claims that are independent of the returns which the intermediary earns on his portfolio: If the claims on the financial intermediary are independent of returns on the intermediary's assets and if diversification ensures that the probability of default is zero, any benefits of taking greater effort in managing assets, e.g., more thorough monitoring of loans clients, accrue entirely to the intermediary."

CCT777	81896289	Systemic Risk in the Financial Sector: An Analysis of the Subprime-Mortgage Financial Crisis	Martin Hellwig	The gathering crisis in federal deposit insurance	"[""E J Kane""]"	"This study warns bankers, regulators, politicians, and taxpayers that no matter how well the deposit-insurance system may have run in the past it is headed for an expensive bureaucratic breakdown. The system of federal deposit insurance adopted during the 1930s has become increasingly costly and unreliable. This timely study warns bankers, regulators, politicians, and taxpayers that no matter how well the deposit-insurance system may have run in the past it is headed for an expensive bureaucratic breakdown. It forcefully argues that unless market discipline can be reintroduced, this breakdown threatens to take depository institutions into de facto nationalization. Reversing these trends, it points out, requires redesigning the deposit insurance system to curtail the subsidizing of risk taking by deposit institutions, a practice that has resulted in widespread insolvency among financial institutions. The Gathering Crisis in Federal Deposit Insurance provides more than a warning. It shows that the current system is unfair and has transformed the federal government into the chief supplier of equity funds to depository institutions. And it observes that whenever the financial environment is changing rapidly, the existing system of deposit insurance subsidizes risk-taking in ways that impose a huge, but largely unrecognized burden on the general taxpayer and conservatively managed financial institutions. In one way or another, the taxpayer is going to be called upon to make good the financially staggering amount of the system's guarantees. The book provides a comprehensive discussion of FDIC and FSLIC policies and procedures, describes the variety of risks facing deposit institutions and their implications for the insurance system, explains the perverse risk-bearing incentives inherent in the current deposit insurance system, documents the extent of actual insolvency at insured institutions, and proposes a framework for reform.

This has led to fears that economies are now more vulnerable to macroeconomic shocks. The authors focus on one aspect of financial deregulation, namely liberalization of the banking system. They show that measures such as the abolition of reserve requirements increase macroeconomic variability under some circumstances but reduce it under others. No general macroeconomic case can be made for banking regulation or for its liberalization. Analysis of microeconomic issues is more fruitful. Asymmetric information and the risks of contagion in a panic can lead to runs against the banking system. To the extent that these are socially inefficient, public intervention may be justified. This presumption is stronger since the risks of bank runs have grown recently with the increased maturity mismatch -- the finance of illiquid loans by liquid short-term deposits. To meet this danger, the authors recommend regulation of deposit contracts whilst preserving incentives for bank monitoring by private parties. Specifically, they propose an ""ex post"" liability of current and former depositors when banks default, thereby offsetting the incentive to withdraw funds at the onset of a crisis. Being quick off the mark would no longer be sufficient, and sophisticated depositors would press for greater disclosure and fuller monitoring of bank activities. The authors also recommend that remaining controls on deposit interest rates should be scrapped and that supervision of international banking should be cooperatively conducted by host and parent authorities."

The financial system experienced wide-ranging financial deregulation and a rapid expansion of bank lending followed by a dramatic banking crisis and a severe contraction of credits. Using detailed, confidential, and internationally unique data on individual credit contracts, this paper documents the main bank relationships and their evolution during this period. The main findings are: (1) firms continue to rely on a single dominant bank lender throughout the period; (2) the turnover of main bank relationships increases dramatically; (3) the level of bank exposure in individual firms jumps as a result of both higher credit volumes and falling collateralization of credits; (4) many firms establish a second, underutilized, credit facility with another bank; (5) main banks have less collateral than these side banks; and (6) main banks have substantial ownership of equity in borrower firms through related institutions. The strong link between lending and such indirect equity ownership is perhaps the most striking aspect of the Swedish main bank arrangement, and equity holdings are important in sustaining these relationships."

Due to the ever-increasing amounts under management and their unregulated and opaque nature, hedge funds have emerged as a key concern for policymakers. While until now, hedge funds have been left essentially unregulated, we are seeing increasing calls for regulation for both microprudential and macroprudential reasons. In our view, most calls for the regulation of hedge funds are based on a misperception of the effectiveness of fi nancial regulations, perhaps coupled with a lack of understanding of the positive contribution of hedge funds to the fi nancial system. There are real concerns about consumer protection following from the expansion of the consumer base. However, it would be misguided to relax accreditation criteria. A more important issue is the investment of regulated institutions, in particular pension funds, in hedge funds.

In this paper we present arguments against this view based on scrambling in Dutch. We discuss a range of implementations of the cartographic approach and show that they are either too weak, in that they cannot generate all the word orders found in Dutch, or too strong, in that they fail to capture restrictions on scrambling. The alternative we present dispenses with discourse-related functional projections and instead relies on mapping rules that associate syntactic representations with representations in information structure. On this view, scrambling operations derive a syntactic configuration that matches the structural description of a mapping rule that could otherwise not apply. We suggest that it is this interface effect that licenses the marked structures created by scrambling."

In the picture that we had in mind, the syntax is autonomous - ''it does what it does'' - but sometimes the result maps to an unusable phonological representation. In this sense, linearization acts logically as a filter on derivations. We know of no evidence that the syntax can predict which syntactic objects will be usable by the phonology, and we know of no clear evidence that the phonology communicates this information to the syntax. In this sense, our proposal fits squarely into the tradition that Svenonius characterizes as the ''mainstream''. We thus attempted to identify certain deviant configurations that are not plausibly excluded for syntax-internal reasons, but are filtered out in the linearization process."

In these essays the minimalist approach to linguistic theory is formulated and progressively developed. Building on the theory of principles and parameters and, in particular, on principles of economy of derivation and representation, the minimalist framework takes Universal Grammar as providing a unique computational system, with derivations driven by morphological properties, to which the syntactic variation of languages is also restricted. Within this theoretical framework, linguistic expressions are generated by optimally efficient derivations that must satisfy the conditions that hold on interface levels, the only levels of linguistic representation. The interface levels provide instructions to two types of performance systems, articulatory-perceptual and conceptual-intentional. All syntactic conditions, then, express properties of these interface levels, reflecting the interpretive requirements of language and keeping to very restricted conceptual resources."

HORN""]"	"Jackendoff (1997), whose analysis of idioms is based, in part, on work by Nunberg, Sag & Wasow (1994), discusses VP idioms and addresses the question of mobility. Both works identify fixed idioms, such as kick the bucket , and mobile idioms, such as spill the beans and take advantage of . Fixed idioms are ones whose NP objects are impervious to syntactic operations, as illustrated by the unacceptability, in their idiomatic sense, of sentences like * The bucket was kicked by Bill ; while mobile idioms occur in sentences like The beans were spilled by Fred and Advantage was taken of Bill . Jackendoff correlates the mobility of VP idioms with a property that he refers to as metaphorical semantic composition. However, he observes that this property is not a sufficient condition for mobility. I will argue that the property of metaphorical semantic composition be replaced by a property of thematic composition, and that this property is a sufficient condition for mobility. A closer inspection of mobile idioms that have thematic composition reveals that they fall into two subtypes: expressions that have a property of 'transparency of interpretation', and ones that do not have this property. I refer to members of the first subtype as METAPHORS . I will demonstrate that there are no idiosyncratic constraints on their syntactic mobility, and will conclude that they need not be encoded in lexical entries as phrasal idioms. In these respects, they are distinct from members of the second subtype, whose degree of mobility is more limited, and which must be encoded in lexical entries as phrasal idioms. Finally, I will address the question of the necessity of thematic composition for mobility. Throughout the paper, I will assume that phrasal idioms are appropriately encoded in lexical entries of the types proposed by Jackendoff for fixed and mobile expressions."

When caused by Clostridium difficile, AAD can result in life-threatening illness. Although underlying disease mechanisms are not well understood, microbial preparations have been assessed in the prevention of AAD. However, studies have been mostly small single-centre trials with varying quality, providing insufficient data to reliably assess effectiveness. We aimed to do a pragmatic efficacy trial in older inpatients who would be representative of those admitted to National Health Service (NHS) and similar secondary care institutions and to recruit a sufficient number of patients to generate a definitive result. : We did a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pragmatic, efficacy trial of inpatients aged 65 years and older and exposed to one or more oral or parenteral antibiotics. A computer-generated randomisation scheme was used to allocate participants (in a 1:1 ratio) to receive either a multistrain preparation of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, with a total of 6 x 10(10) organisms, one per day for 21 days, or an identical placebo. Patients, study staff, and specimen and data analysts were masked to assignment. The primary outcomes were occurrence of AAD within 8 weeks and C difficile diarrhoea (CDD) within 12 weeks of recruitment. Analysis was by modified intention-to-treat. This trial is registered, number ISRCTN70017204. : Of 17,420 patients screened, 1493 were randomly assigned to the microbial preparation group and 1488 to the placebo group. 1470 and 1471, respectively, were included in the analyses of the primary endpoints.

DOI: 10.1007/s10514-007-9058-3This article presents the results of video-based Human Robot Interaction (HRI) trials which investigated people's perceptions of different robot appearances and associated attention-seeking features and behaviors displayed by robots with different appearance and behaviors. The HRI trials studied the participants' preferences for various features of robot appearance and behavior, as well as their personality attributions towards the robots compared to their own personalities. Overall, participants tended to prefer robots with more human-like appearance and attributes. However, systematic individual differences in the dynamic appearance ratings are not consistent with a universal effect. Introverts and participants with lower emotional stability tended to prefer the mechanical looking appearance to a greater degree than other participants. It is also shown that it is possible to rate individual elements of a particular robot's behavior and then assess the contribution, or otherwise, of that element to the overall perception of the robot by people. Relating participants' dynamic appearance ratings of individual robots to independent static appearance ratings provided evidence that could be taken to support a portion of the left hand side of Mori's theoretically proposed 'uncanny valley' diagram.

"[""Yvonna Lavis"", ""Raja Kadib"", ""Chris Mitchell"", ""Geoffrey Hall""]"	"In two experiments, participants received exposure to complex checkerboards (e.g., AX and BX) that consisted of small distinctive features (A and B) superimposed on a larger common background (X). Subsequent discrimination between AX and BX, assessed by a same-different task, was facilitated when the stimuli were presented on alternate trials in preexposure--a perceptual learning effect (Experiment 1). The hypothesis that this form of exposure results in more accurate representations of the unique features was supported in Experiment 1, which showed that participants were well able to match the color of the feature with its shape. Experiment 2 showed that exposure to A and B in isolation, intermixed with presentations of AX and BX, enhanced the perceptual learning effect, which confirmed that the better encoding of the unique features during intermixed preexposure is a direct cause of the enhanced discrimination observed following preexposure on this schedule."

Subjective SEP indicators are infrequently used in health research.We use data from 11 280 households included in the Malawi Integrated Household Survey 2004/5. We compare the wealth index with four subjective measures of SEP: perceived food consumption adequacy, perceived overall consumption adequacy, an economic ladder question, and perceived income sufficiency. The wealth index is compared with each subjective SEP measure in terms of: (i) agreement of classification of households, (ii) targeting accuracy with respect to US$1-a-day poverty based on consumption expenditure, and (iii) the socio-economic processes (household- and community-level) giving rise to the SEP scores.Each subjective SEP indicator resulted in considerable differential classification of households compared with the wealth index. Three measures of subjective SEP (perceived food consumption adequacy, economic ladder question, and perceived income sufficiency) identified a higher proportion of dollar-a-day poor households as poor than the wealth index. The wealth index was strongly influenced by community infrastructure, but all subjective SEP indicators were free from strong community-level influence.The strengths and limitations of any measure of SEP depend on the context and purpose for which it is being used. In these data, the wealth index was strongly influenced by community infrastructure, whereas the subjective SEP measures were not, perhaps allowing analyses using them to disentangle household and community influences. Several subjective measures also corresponded to dollar-a-day poverty more strongly than the wealth index. Subjective measures may therefore be preferable to the wealth index in some circumstances, although they have their own set of potential biases."

Both pneumonia and asthma or wheezy bronchitis to age 7 were associated with a significant excess in the prevalence of chronic cough and phlegm at age 23 after controlling for current smoking. This excess was largely attributable to the association of cough and phlegm at age 23 with a history of asthma or wheezy bronchitis from age 16. When adjustment was made for recent wheezing, current cigarette consumption, previous smoking habit, and passive exposure to smoke the relative odds of cough or phlegm, or both, in subjects with a history of childhood chest illness was 1.11 (95% confidence interval 0.97 to 1.27). When analysed separately asthma, wheezy bronchitis, and pneumonia up to age 7 did not significantly increase the prevalence of either cough or phlegm.

Findings on measured microbiologic factors have received little review. We conducted an updated, comprehensive review on these topics.We reviewed eligible peer-reviewed epidemiologic studies or quantitative meta-analyses, up to late 2009, on dampness, mold, or other microbiologic agents and respiratory or allergic effects.We evaluated evidence for causation or association between qualitative/subjective assessments of dampness or mold (considered together) and specific health outcomes. We separately considered evidence for associations between specific quantitative measurements of microbiologic factors and each health outcome.Evidence from epidemiologic studies and meta-analyses showed indoor dampness or mold to be associated consistently with increased asthma development and exacerbation, current and ever diagnosis of asthma, dyspnea, wheeze, cough, respiratory infections, bronchitis, allergic rhinitis, eczema, and upper respiratory tract symptoms. Associations were found in allergic and nonallergic individuals. Evidence strongly suggested causation of asthma exacerbation in children. Suggestive evidence was available for only a few specific measured microbiologic factors and was in part equivocal, suggesting both adverse and protective associations with health.Evident dampness or mold had consistent positive associations with multiple allergic and respiratory effects. Measured microbiologic agents in dust had limited suggestive associations, including both positive and negative associations for some agents. Thus, prevention and remediation of indoor dampness and mold are likely to reduce health risks, but current evidence does not support measuring specific indoor microbiologic factors to guide health-protective actions."

Objective: We investigate how the context of models, the independent variables used and the modelling techniques applied, influence the performance of fault prediction models. Method:We used a systematic literature review to identify 208 fault prediction studies published from January 2000 to December 2010. We synthesise the quantitative and qualitative results of 36 studies which report sufficient contextual and methodological information according to the criteria we develop and apply. Results: The models that perform well tend to be based on simple modelling techniques such as Na??ve Bayes or Logistic Regression. Combinations of independent variables have been used by models that perform well. Feature selection has been applied to these combinations when models are performing particularly well. Conclusion: The methodology used to build models seems to be influential to predictive performance.

Mynatt"", ""Michael E. Doherty"", ""Ryan D. Tweney""]"	"Numerous authors (e.g., Popper, 1959) argue that scientists should try to falsify rather than confirm theories. However, recent empirical work (Wason and Johnson-Laird, 1972) suggests the existence of a confirmation bias, at least on abstract problems. Using a more realistic, computer controlled environment modeled after a real research setting, subjects in this study first formulated hypotheses about the laws governing events occurring in the environment. They then chose between pairs of environments in which they could: (I) make observations which would probably confirm these hypotheses, or (2) test alternative hypotheses. Strong evidence for a confirmation bias involving failure to choose environments allowing tests of alternative hypotheses was found. However, when subjects did obtain explicit falsifying information, they used this information to reject incorrect hypotheses."

Hand""]"	"The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is a very widely used measure of performance  for classification and diagnostic rules. It has the appealing property of being objective,  requiring no subjective input from the user. On the other hand, the AUC has  disadvantages, some of which are well known. For example, the AUC can give  potentially misleading results if ROC curves cross. However, the AUC also has a  much more serious deficiency, and one which appears not to have been previously  recognised. This is that it is fundamentally incoherent in terms of misclassification  costs: the AUC uses different misclassification cost distributions for different  classifiers.  This means that using the AUC is equivalent to using different metrics to  evaluate different classification rules. It is equivalent to saying that, using one  classifier, misclassifying a class 1 point is p times as serious as misclassifying a class  0 point, but, using another classifier, misclassifying a class 1 point is P times as  serious, where p P .  This is nonsensical because the relative severities of different  kinds of misclassifications of individual points is a property of the problem, not the  classifiers which happen to have been chosen.  This property is explored in detail, and  a simple valid alternative to the AUC is proposed."

Cook""]"	"Abstract--The c statistic, or area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, achieved popularity in diagnostic testing, in which the test characteristics of sensitivity and specificity are relevant to discriminating diseased versus nondiseased patients. The c statistic, however, may not be optimal in assessing models that predict future risk or stratify individuals into risk categories. In this setting, calibration is as important to the accurate assessment of risk. For example, a biomarker with an odds ratio of 3 may have little effect on the c statistic, yet an increased level could shift estimated 10-year cardiovascular risk for an individual patient from 8 % to 24%, which would lead to different treatment recommendations under current Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines. Accepted risk factors such as lipids, hypertension, and smoking have only marginal impact on the c statistic individually yet lead to more accurate reclassification of large proportions of patients into higher-risk or lower-risk categories. Perfectly calibrated models for complex disease can, in fact, only achieve values for the c statistic well below the theoretical maximum of 1. Use of the c statistic for model selection could thus naively eliminate established risk factors from cardiovascular risk prediction scores. As novel risk factors are discovered, sole reliance on the c statistic to evaluate their utility as risk predictors thus seems ill-advised. (Circulation. 2007;115:928-935.)

The ongoing discovery of new risk markers by scientists presents opportunities and challenges for statisticians and clinicians to evaluate these biomarkers and to develop new risk formulations that incorporate them. One of the key questions is how best to assess and quantify the improvement in risk prediction offered by these new models. Demonstration of a statistically significant association of a new biomarker with cardiovascular risk is not enough. Some researchers have advanced that the improvement in the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) should be the main criterion, whereas others argue that better measures of performance of prediction models are needed. In this paper, we address this question by introducing two new measures, one based on integrated sensitivity and specificity and the other on reclassification tables. These new measures offer incremental information over the AUC. We discuss the properties of these new measures and contrast them with the AUC. We also develop simple asymptotic tests of significance. We illustrate the use of these measures with an example from the Framingham Heart Study. We propose that scientists consider these types of measures in addition to the AUC when assessing the performance of newer biomarkers."

This study develops and empirically tests a theoretical framework that  demonstrates the relative impact of CSR on consumer resistance to negative information when confronted with negative information about a firm. The results demonstrate that CSR shields firms from negative information about CSR practices but not information related to firms' core service offerings.

Here, I develop a novel theoretical perspective on causal core and periphery, which is based on how elements of a configuration are connected to outcomes. Using data on high-technology firms, I empirically investigate configurations based on the Miles and Snow typology using fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). My findings show how the theoretical perspective developed here allows for a detailed analysis of causal core, periphery, and asymmetry, shifting the focus to midrange theories of causal processes. Types and typologies are ubiquitous, both in every-day social life and in the language of the social sciences. Everybody uses them, but almost no one pays any attention to the nature of their construction.-McKinney (1969: 4) The notion of causality plays a key role in both the strategy and organization literatures. For in-stance, cause-effect relationships are the central way in which strategic decisions and organization-al structures are understood and communicated in organizations (Ford, 1985; Huff, 1990; Huff &amp; Jen-kins, 2001). Building on this insight, the cognitive strategy literature has aimed to map and explain the causal reasoning of managers regarding both organizational performance and competitive envi-ronments (e.g., Barr, Stimpert,  &amp; Huff, 1992; Nad-karni &amp; Narayanan, 2007a, 2007b; Reger &amp; Huff, 1993). Similarly, cause-effect relationships are the main building blocks of the organizational design literature and have recently received increasing at-tention (e.g., Burton &amp; Obel, 2004; Grandori &amp; Fur"	"The present study builds on the existing literature that underscores the value of fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) (e.g., #AUTHOR_TAG, 2011;Woodside, 2013;Woodside & Zhang, 2013) and shows that the proposed methodological tool offers much in terms of understanding causal relationships, by virtue of providing information that is unique in comparison with the information that conventional correlational methods provide."

"[""Michael A. Stanko"", ""Xavier Olleros""]"	"The outsourcing of innovation activities, geographic clustering of firms, and mobility of labor each allow knowledge to circulate within industries. This study investigates knowledge spillover mechanisms' effects on industry innovativeness and profit, and how these effects change with the level of industry growth. Generally, the set of hypotheses presented suggests enhanced performance effects from knowledge spillover mechanisms under growth; the pace of developments in growth industries increases the importance of access to knowledge. Analysis of an industry-level data set assembled from five secondary sources consists of both regression and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). While regression detects the discrete effects of each mechanism, fsQCA identifies specific configurations of these mechanisms associated with the outcome, emphasizing causal complexity. In general, outsourcing negatively affects innovativeness (though one identified configuration represents a unique case within which outsourcing can aid innovativeness), but benefits profitability. All three elements of the knowledge spillover regime examined here have performance implications contingent on growth."

Building on the varieties-of-capitalism approach, it is argued that competitive advantage in high-tech industries with radical innovation may be supported by combinations of certain institutional conditions: lax employment protection, weak collective bargaining coverage, extensive university training, little occupational training, and a large stock market. Furthermore, multinational enterprises engage in ""institutional arbitrage"": they allocate their activities so as to benefit from available institutional capital. These hypotheses are tested on country-level data for 19 OECD economies in the period 1990 to 2003. A fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis yields several interesting findings. A high share of university graduates and a large stock market are complementary institutions leading to strong export performance in high-tech. Employment protection is neither conducive nor harmful to export performance in high-tech. A high volume of cross-border mergers and acquisitions, as a form of institutional arbitrage leading to knowledge flows, acts as a functional equivalent to institutions that support knowledge production in the home economy. Implications of these findings for theory, policy, and the analysis of firm-level behavior are developed."

To some, counterfactual analysis is central to comparative inquiry because such research typically embraces only a handful of empirical cases (Fearon 1991). If there are only a few instances (e.g., of revolution), then researchers, of necessity, must compare empirical cases to hypothetical cases. The affinity between counterfactual analysis and comparative research, however, derives not from its focus on small Ns, but from its configurational nature. Case-oriented explanations of outcomes are often combinatorial in nature, stressing specific configurations of causal conditions.

The study explores conditional models leading to high product-innovation performance using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). Based on relevant literature, this study categorizes relevant antecedents including organization-related, project-related, process-related, product-related, and market-related categories, and the newness of product innovation, into causal recipes. To assess the applicability of this conceptual model, researchers collected data from R&D managers and members of high-tech firms in Taiwan. The study includes dividing sampled firms into three groups according to the extent of within-firm agreement on responses by executives to questions about antecedents (in surveys that they answered independently). The findings include model routes to high product-innovation performance for each group. The findings indicate that no one simple antecedent is sufficient or necessary for high performance; no one path is necessary for high performance. However, there is only one avenue to successful product innovation for low-agreement cases. This study also finds some common rules behind these paths across groups.

Ragin""]"	"Because of its inherently asymmetric nature, set-theoretic analysis offers many interesting contrasts with analysis based on correlations. Until recently, however, social scientists have been slow to embrace set-theoretic approaches. The perception was that this type of analysis is restricted to primitive, binary variables and that it has little or no tolerance for error. With the advent of ''fuzzy' ' sets and the recognition that even rough set-theoretic relations are relevant to theory, these old barriers have crumbled. This paper advances the set-theoretic approach by presenting simple descriptive measures that can be used to evaluate set-theoretic relationships, especially relations between fuzzy sets. The first mea-sure, ''consistency,' ' assesses the degree to which a subset relation has been approxi-mated, whereas the second measure, ''coverage,' ' assesses the empirical relevance of a consistent subset. This paper demonstrates further that set-theoretic coverage can be partitioned in a manner somewhat analogous to the partitioning of explained variation in multiple regression analysis."

Carson""]"	"The recent accounting scandals at Enron, WorldCom, and other corporations have helped to fuel a massive loss of confidence in the integrity of American business and have contributed to a very sharp decline in the U.S. stock market. Inasmuch as these events have brought ethical questions about business to the forefront in the media and public consciousness as never before, they are of signal importance for the field of business ethics. I offer some observations and conjectures about the bearing of the recent scandals on the literature on business ethics. I defend the following contentions: 1. Recent events reveal serious weaknesses of the stakeholder theory about the social responsibilities of business which lacks prohibitions against fraud and deception. This is a glaring deficiency of standard versions of the stakeholder theory, but it is easily remedied by adding explicit prohibitions against fraud and deception. In addition, recent events highlight the stakeholder theory's very naive and unrealistic hopes and expectations for business executives as moral arbiters and agents of social improvement. 2. Recent events do not constitute an objection to the shareholder theory about the social responsibilities of business, however, these events make evident the implausibility of strong versions of the invisible hand theory. 3. Schemes of payment and reward often create perverse incentives for individuals to engage in unethical conduct. 4. Both the shareholder theory and the stakeholder theory need to add a constraint that requires executives to respect the professional obligations of employees."

Study 1 indicates that a proactive communication strategy (when the firm's CSR statements precede conflicting observed behavior) leads to higher levels of perceived hypocrisy than a reactive strategy (when the firm's CSR statements follow observed behavior). The inconsistent information in both scenarios increases perceptions of hypocrisy, such that CSR statements can actually be counterproductive. Study 1 also reveals how perceived hypocrisy damages consumers ' attitudes toward firms by negatively affecting CSR beliefs and provides evidence for the mediating role of hypocrisy during information processing.

Here we develop a theoretical perspective that explicitly focuses on irresponsibility and that particularly helps explain attributions of social irresponsibility in the minds of the firm's observers. In contrast to approaches in the corporate social responsibility literature that tend to deemphasize the role of the individual perceiver of firm behavior in favor of emphasizing such broader social structures as value systems, institutions, and stakeholder relations, our focus is on how the social reality of external expectations for social responsibility is rooted in the perceptions of the beholder. We draw on attribution theory to describe how attributions of irresponsibility stem from the observer's subjective assessments of effect undesirability, corporate culpability, and affected party noncomplicity. We describe how those assessments affect each other and how they are influenced by the observer's perceptions of effect and firm characteristics and by the observer's social identification with the affected party or the implicated corporation.

I then address 8 potential sources of public skepticism to-ward psychology and argue that although some of these sources reflect cognitive errors (e.g., hindsight bias) or misunderstandings of psychological science (e.g., failure to distinguish basic from applied research), others (e.g., psy-chology's failure to police itself, psychology's problematic public face) reflect the failure of professional psychology to get its own house in order.

It is argued that the optimal ranking problem should be factorized into two distinct yet interrelated stages: the relevance prediction stage and ranking decision stage. During retrieval the relevance of documents is not known a priori, and the joint probability of relevance is used to measure the uncertainty of documents' relevance in the collection as a whole. The resulting optimization objective function in the latter stage is, thus, the expected value of the IR metric with respect to this probability measure of relevance. Through statistically analyzing the expected values of IR metrics under such uncertainty, we discover and explain some interesting properties of IR metrics that have not been known before. Our analysis and optimization framework do not assume a particular (relevance) retrieval model and metric, making it applicable to many existing IR models and metrics.

Digital contents and their rich multilingual metadata sets need improved solutions for an efficient content management. There is an increasing need of services for scaling digital services, searching and indexing. Despite the huge amount of contents, users want to easily find relevant unstructured documents in large repositories, on the basis of multilingual queries, with a limited waiting time. At the same time, digital archives have to be fully accessible even if a major restructuring is in progress, or without a significant downtime. Evaluating the effectivness of retrieval systems plays a fundamental role in the process of system assessment and optimization. This paper presents an indexing and searching solution for cross media content, developed for a Social Network in the domain of Performing Arts.

With the advent of E-commerce and corporate intranets/extranets, these repositories are expected to grow at a fast pace. This explosive growth has led to huge, fragmented, and unstructured document collections. Although it has become easier to collect and store information in document collections, it has become increasingly difficult to retrieve relevant information from these large document collections. This paper addresses the issue of improving retrieval performance (in terms of precision and recall) for retrieval from document collections.  There are three important paradigms of research in the area of information retrieval (IR): Probabilistic IR, Knowledge-based IR, and, Artificial Intelligence based techniques like neural networks and symbolic learning. Very few researchers have tried to use evolutionary algorithms like genetic algorithms (GA&apos;s). Previous attempts at using GA&apos;s have concentrated on modifying document representations or modifying query representations. This work looks at the possibility of applying GA&apos;s to adapt various matching functions. It is hoped that such an adaptation of the matching functions will lead to a better retrieval performance than that obtained by using a single matching function. An overall matching function is treated as a weighted combination of scores produced by individual matching functions. This overall score is used to rank and retrieve documents. Weights associated with individual functions are searched using Genetic Algorithm.  The idea is tested on a real document collection called the Cranfield collection.

The field of information extraction has its genesis in the natural language processing community where the primary impetus came from competitions centered around the recognition of named entities like people names and organization from news articles. As society became more data oriented with easy online access to both structured and unstructured data, new applications of structure extraction came around. Now, there is interest in converting our personal desktops to structured databases, the knowledge in scientific publications to structured records, and harnessing the Internet for structured fact finding queries. Consequently, there are many different communities of researchers bringing in techniques from machine learning, databases, information retrieval, and computational linguistics for various aspects of the information extraction problem. This review is a survey of information extraction research of over two decades from these diverse communities. We create a taxonomy of the field along various dimensions derived from the nature of the extraction task, the techniques used for extraction, the variety of input resources exploited, and the type of output produced. We elaborate on rule-based and statistical methods for entity and relationship extraction. In each case we highlight the different kinds of models for capturing the diversity of clues driving the recognition process and the algorithms for training and efficiently deploying the models.

It is well known that relevance judgments are not infallible, but recent retrospective investigation into results from the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) has shown that differences in human judgments of relevance do not affect the relative measured performance of retrieval systems. Based on this result, we propose and describe the initial results of a new evaluation methodology which replaces human relevance judgments with a randomly selected mapping of documents to topics which we refer to aspseudo-relevance judgments.Rankings of systems with our methodology correlate positively with official TREC rankings, although the performance of the top systems is not predicted well.

An implementation of structured translation based on automatic dictionary clustering is described and evaluated by using Chinese queries to retrieve English documents. Structured translation achieved an average precision that was statistically indistinguishable from Pirkola's technique for very short queries, but Pirkola's technique outperformed structured translation on long queries.

The instrument was administered to 21 end-users who conducted searches on their own information problems and made relevance judgments on a total of 1059 retrieved items. Findings include: (1) overlapping regions of relevance were found to impact the usefulness of precision ratios as a measure of IR system effectiveness, (2) both positive and negative levels of relevance are important to users as they make relevance judgments, (3) topicality was used more to reject rather than accept items as highly relevant, (4) utility was more used to judge items highly relevant, and (5) the nature of relevance judgment distribution suggested a new IR evaluation measureÑmedian effect.

Farmer"", ""Alfred H. Parent""]"	"We monitored the inter-wetland movements of 115 radio-tagged Pectoral Sand-pipers (Calidris melanotos) at three migration stopovers in the Great Plains of North America during April and May from 1992 to 1995. While resident at a stopover, individuals were very localized in their movements. Over 40% of the birds made no inter-wetland movements, and over 90% of individuals moved less than 10 km from their original release site. Characteristics of wetlands where birds were released did not affect bird movements. However, the structure of the surrounding landscape explained up to 46% of variation in individual bird movements. As the distance between wetlands decreased, and the proportion of the landscape composed of wetlands increased, individual birds moved between wetlands more frequently and moved longer distances from their release site. These movement patterns indicate that a more connected landscape allows shorebirds to exploit more feeding sites with reduced searching costs; a result consistent with foraging theory. We estimate a degree of landscape connectivity at which a wetland complex functions as a single large wetland as measured by sandpiper feeding patterns. Our data provide support for the idea that complexes of small, closely spaced wetlands can be important migration stopovers and may have significant conservation value."

First, in the presence of individual heterogeneity in survival probability, the proportion of high-survival individuals increases with age. This increase can mask a senescence-related decrease in survival probability when the probability is estimated at the population level. To accommodate individual heterogeneity we use a mixture model structure (discrete classes of individuals). Second, the study individuals can elude the observers in the field, and their detection rate can be heterogeneous. To account for detectability issues we use capture-mark-recapture (CMR) methodology, mixture models and data that provide information on indi-viduals' detectability. Last, emigration to non-monitored sites can bias survival estimates, because it can occur at the end of the individuals' histories and mimic earlier death. To model emigration we use Markovian transitions to and from an unobservable state. These different model structures are merged together using hidden Markov chain CMR models, or multievent models. Simulation studies illustrate that reliable evidence for survival senescence can be obtained using highly heterogeneous data from non site-faithful individuals. We then design a tailored application for a dataset from a colony of black-headed gull Chroicocephalus ridibundus. Survival probabilities do not appear individually variable, but evidence for survival senescence becomes significant only when accounting for other sources of heterogeneity. This result suggests that not accounting for heterogeneity leads to flawed inference and/or that emigration heterogeneity mimics survival heteroge-neity and biases senescence estimates."

Up until recently, no suitable methodology has been available to estimate survival probabilities of species with asynchronous reproduction and a high level of individual variation in capture probabilities. The present work develops a capture-mark-recapture model for cheetahs in the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania, which (a) deals with continuous reproduction, (b) takes into account the high level of individual heterogeneity in capture probabilities and (c) is spatially explicit. Results show that (1) our approach, which is an extensive modification of the Cormack-Jolly-Seber model, provides a lower female adult survival estimate and a higher male adolescent survival estimate than previous approaches to estimate cheetah survival in the area, (2) using sighting location alone is not sufficient to capture the individual variation in resighting probabilities for both sexes, and (3) precision in estimated survival probabilities is generally increased. Species which are individually recognizable, wide-ranging and/or where individuals differ substantially in sightability are particularly appropriate to our modelling approach, and our methodology would thus be appropriate for a wide number of species to provide more accurate estimates of survival.

Obernuefemann"", ""Jaime A. Collazo"", ""James E.

Knowledge about the scale and factors that influence these movements could guide conservation planning, but often this information is not available. The influence of inter-wetland distance, prey biomass, amount of foraging habitat at depths of 0Ð4 cm, and density of migrating Semipalmated Sandpipers on their movement and stopover residency was investigated at the Tom Yawkey Wildlife Center in South Carolina in spring 2007. Tom Yawkey Wildlife Center contains three clusters of coastal wetlands separated by 2.6, 2.8 and 4.1 km. Probability of moving among wetland clusters and stopover residency were estimated using multi-state mark-recapture models and encounter histories from 502 marked Semipalmated Sandpipers. Sixty-four percent of Semipalmated Sandpipers remained within 2 km of site-of-capture for the duration of the study. Movement probabilities were negatively influenced by inter-cluster distance and Semipalmated Sandpiper density. Probability of moving between clusters 2.6Ð2.8 km apart was higher than clusters separated by 4.1 km. Semipalmated Sandpipers were more likely to depart the study area and resume migration after feeding in wetland clusters with abundant prey and accessible habitat. The interaction between prey and accessible habitat led to instances where Semipalmated Sandpipers were more likely to remain in wetlands with low prey levels, but high accessible habitat, or low accessible habitat, but high prey levels.

However, approximately 10% of all APL cases lack the classic t(15;17). This group includes (1) cases with cryptic PML/RARA gene rearrangements and t(5;17) that leads to the NPM/RARA fusion gene, which are retinoid-responsive, and (2) cases with t(11;17)(q23;q21) that are associated with the PLZF/RARA fusion gene, which are retinoid-resistant. A key issue is how to rapidly distinguish subtypes of APL that demand distinct treatment approaches. To address this issue, a European workshop was held in Monza, Italy, during June 1997, and a morphologic, immunophenotypic, cytogenetic, and molecular review was undertaken in 60 cases of APL lacking t(15;17). This process led to the development of a novel morphologic classification system that takes into account the major nuclear and cytoplasmic features of APL. There were no major differences observed in morphology or immunophenotype between cases with the classic t(15;17) and those with the cryptic PML/RARA gene rearrangements. Auer rods were absent in the t(5;17) case expressing NPM/RARA. Interestingly, this classification system distinguished 9 cases with t(11;17)(q23;q21) and, in addition, successfully identified 2 cases lacking t(11;17), which were subsequently shown to have underlying PLZF/RARA fusions. The PLZF/RARA cases were characterized by a predominance of blasts with regular nuclei, an increased number of Pelger-like cells, and by expression of CD56 in 4 of 6 cases tested. Use of this classification system, combined with an analysis for CD56 expression, should allow early recognition of APL cases requiring tailored molecular investigations.

Its effect is known to be mediated through binding to specific nuclear (RARs and RXRs) or cytoplasmic (CRABP) proteins. ATRA is strikingly effective in acute promyelocytic leukemia (the AML3 subtype) inducing a high incidence of complete remissions. Paradoxically, most AML3 cells harbor an abnormal retinoic acid receptor (PML/RAR alpha) resulting from the t(15;17) translocation. Though few AML3 patients do not respond to ATRA therapy, individualization of these cases is of practical importance. Recently the RAR alpha gene has been demonstrated to be involved in a novel fusion transcript (PLZF/RAR alpha) through a t(11;17) translocation. We describe here the second case of such a patient with a t(11;17)-PLZF/RAR alpha leukemic clone. Southern analysis revealed that the breakpoint in the RAR alpha gene was within the second intron (as for PML/RAR alpha) and the intron separating the second and third zinc finger of the PLZF gene. In vitro, the leukemic cells did not show increased NBT reduction or loss of self-renewal after incubation with ATRA. After therapy with ATRA, only partial remission was obtained.

The most common fusion partner is promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML), which is fused to RARa in the balanced reciprocal chromosomal translocation, t(15;17)(q22:q11). Expression of PML/RARa from the cathepsin G promoter in transgenic mice causes a nonfatal myeloproliferative syndrome in all mice; about 15% go on to develop APL after a long latent period, suggesting that additional mutations are required for the development of APL. A candidate target gene for a second mutation is FLT3, because it is mutated in approximately 40% of human APL cases. Activating mutations in FLT3, including internal tandem duplication (ITD) in the juxtamembrane domain, transform hematopoietic cell lines to factor independent growth. FLT3-ITDs also induce a myeloproliferative disease in a murine bone marrow transplant model, but are not sufficient to cause AML. Here, we test the hypothesis that PML/RARa can cooperate with FLT3-ITD to induce an APL-like disease in the mouse. Retroviral transduction of FLT3-ITD into bone marrow cells obtained from PML/RARa transgenic mice results in a short latency APL-like disease with complete penetrance. This disease resembles the APL-like disease that occurs with long latency in the PML/RARa transgenics, suggesting that activating mutations in FLT3 can functionally substitute for the additional mutations that occur during mouse APL progression. The leukemia is transplantable to secondary recipients and is ATRA responsive. These observations document cooperation between PML/RARa and FLT3-ITD in development of the murine APL phenotype."

OBJECTIVES To investigate symptom prevalence and prescribed treatment, explore associations with quality of life (QOL) in the last week of life, and examine symptom prevalence by cause of death of nursing home residents with dementia.   METHODS Within two weeks after death, physicians completed questionnaires about symptoms and treatment in the last week for 330 nursing home residents with dementia in the Dutch End of Life in Dementia study (2007-2011). We used linear regression to assess associations with QOL, measured by the Quality of Life in Late-Stage Dementia scale. Causes of death were abstracted from death certificates.   RESULTS Pain was the most common symptom (52%), followed by agitation (35%) and shortness of breath (35%). Pain and shortness of breath were mostly treated with opioids and agitation mainly with anxiolytics. At the day of death, 77% received opioids, with a median of 90 mg/24 hours (oral equivalents), and 21% received palliative sedation. Pain and agitation were associated with a lower QOL. Death from respiratory infection was associated with the largest symptom burden.   CONCLUSION Symptoms are common in dementia at the end of life, despite the large majority of residents receiving opioids. Dosages may be suboptimal with regard to weighing of effects and side effects.

We set out to investigate quality of end-of-life care and quality of dying of nursing home residents with dementia in Flanders, Belgium.   DESIGN/SETTING/PARTICIPANTS To obtain representativity, we conducted a postmortem study (2010) using random cluster sampling. In selected nursing homes, all deceased residents with dementia in a period of 3 months were reported. For each case, a structured questionnaire was filled in by the nurse most involved in care, the family physician, and the nursing home administrator. We used the Cognitive Performance Scale and Global Deterioration Scale to assess dementia. Main outcome measures were health status, clinical complications, symptoms at the end of life, and quality of dying.   MEASUREMENTS Health status, clinical complications, symptoms at the end of life, and quality of dying.   RESULTS We identified 198 deceased residents with dementia in 69 nursing homes (58% response rate). Age distribution was the same as all deceased residents with dementia in Flanders, 2010. Fifty-four percent had advanced dementia. In the last month of life, 95.5% had 1 or more sentinel events (eg, eating/drinking problems, febrile episodes, or pneumonia); most frequently reported symptoms were pain, fear, anxiety, agitation, and resistance to care. In the last week, difficulty swallowing and pain were reported most frequently. Pressure sores were present in 26.9%, incontinence in 89.2%, and cachexia in 45.8%. Physical restraints were used in 21.4% of cases, and 10.0% died outside the home. Comparing stages of dementia revealed few differences between groups regarding clinical complications, symptoms, or quality of dying.   CONCLUSION Regardless of the dementia stage, many nursing home residents develop serious clinical complications and symptoms in the last phase of life, posing major challenges to the provision of optimum end-of-life care."

For this reason, and because of its large sample size, the CCHS 1.2 is capable of providing the best currently available description of major depression epidemiology in Canada. Using the CCHS 1.2 data, our study aimed to describe the epidemiology of major depression in Canada. Method: All estimates used appropriate sampling weights and bootstrap variance estimation procedures. The analysis consisted of estimating proportions supplemented by logistic regression modelling. Results: The lifetime prevalence of major depressive episode was 12.2%. Past-year episodes were reported by 4.8% of the sample; 1.8% reported an episode in the past 30 days. As expected, major depression was more common in women than in men, but the difference became smaller with advancing age. The peak annual prevalence occurred in the group aged 15 to 25 years. The prevalence of major depression was not related to level of education but was related to having a chronic medical condition, to unemployment, and to income. Married people had the lowest prevalence, but the effect of marital status changed with age. Logistic regression analysis suggested that the annual prevalence may increase with age in men who never married. Conclusions: The prevalence of major depression in the CCHS 1.2 was slightly lower than that reported in the US and comparable to pan-European estimates. The pattern of association with demographic and clinical variables, however, is broadly similar. An increasing prevalence with age in single (never-married) men was an unexpected finding."

The authors studied patterns of antidepressant use in a population of workers receiving depression-related short-term disability benefits to determine whether populations likely to benefit from antidepressants are using them and, if so, whether they are using them in a way that the benefits from their use are maximized. Methods: The analyses were based on 1996-1998 administrative data from short-term disability and prescription drug benefit claims and occupational health department records for employees of three Canadian companies. Results: Approximately 58 percent of employees who were receiving depression-related short-term disability benefits had made at least one antidepressant claim. Employees who did not use antidepressants typically reported significantly fewer symptoms at baseline on average than those who did. About 91 percent of the employees who used antidepressants filled at least one prescription for a guideline-recommended first-line agent. Approximately 79 percent of antidepressant dosages reflected those suggested by the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatment, and three timeframe indicators suggested that most patients used antidepressants within the recommended timeframes.

Sheehan""]"	"Objective: Several recent studies have documented that substantial functional impairment is associated with many of the mental disorders seen in primary care. However, brief measures of mental health-related functional impairment are not commonly applied in primary care settings. The Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), a three-item instrument for assessing such impairment, is evaluated in this study. Method: A psychometric analysis of the SDS was conducted with a sample of 1001 primary care patients at Kaiser Permanente In Oakland, California. The SDS and the Symptom Driven Diagnostic System for Primary Care assessments were completed. Results: The internal consistency reliability of the SDS is high, with coefficient alpha of 0.89. The construct validity was substantiated in two ways. A one-factor model fit the data quite well. Furthermore, patients with each of six psychiatric disorders had significantly higher impairment scores than those who did not. Finally, over 80 percent of the patients with mental disorder diagnoses had an elevated SDS score and nearly 50 percent of those with elevated SDS scores had at least one disorder. Conclusions: The psychometric properties of the SDS were evaluated in primary care. The internal consistency reliability was high. The analyses also lend empirical support for the construct validity. The scale is a sensitive tool for identifying primary care patients with mental health-related functional impairment, who would warrant a diagnostically-oriented mental health assessment."

Dewa"", ""Elizabeth Lin"", ""Mieke Kooehoorn"", ""Elliot Goldner""]"	"Objective: There appear to be links between psychiatric disorders and work-related stress as well as between psychiatric disorders and physical conditions. This study explores the relationships between chronic work stress, psychiatric disorders, and chronic physical conditions and disability among workers. By doing so, this study sought to understand how these factors are associated with worker disability when they are experienced alone versus in combination with one another. Methods: The study population was drawn from the Canadian Community Health Survey 1.2, a national population-based survey that gathered cross-sectional data on health status from 22,118 working respondents. The relationship between chronic work stress, chronic physical conditions, and psychiatric disorders and disability in the past 14 days was examined for working respondents by using logistic regressions controlling for sociodemographic characteristics, region, and occupation. Results: Thirty-one percent of respondents experienced chronic work stress either alone or in combination with a chronic physical condition, a psychiatric disorder, or both. Forty-six percent reported at least one chronic physical condition either alone or in combination. Finally, 11% had a psychiatric disorder. Compared with the group with none of the factors, those with an increasing number of combined conditions had increasing odds of disability after the analysis controlled for sociodemographic characteristics, occupation, and region. Conclusions: The presence of chronic work stress seems to amplify effects of psychiatric disorders and chronic physical conditions on disability.

An evidence-based format was used with updated systematic reviews of the literature and recommendations were graded according to Level of Evidence using pre-defined criteria. Lines of Treatment were identified based on criteria that included Levels of Evidence and expert clinical support. This section on ""Pharmacotherapy"" is one of 5 guideline articles.Despite emerging data on efficacy and tolerability differences amongst newer antidepressants, variability in patient response precludes identification of specific first choice medications for all patients. All second-generation antidepressants have Level 1 evidence to support efficacy and tolerability and most are considered first-line treatments for MDD. First-generation tricyclic and monoamine oxidase inhibitor antidepressants are not the focus of these guidelines but generally are considered second- or third-line treatments. For inadequate or incomplete response, there is Level 1 evidence for switching strategies and for add-on strategies including lithium and atypical antipsychotics.Most of the evidence is based on trials for registration and may not reflect real-world effectiveness.Second-generation antidepressants are safe, effective and well tolerated treatments for MDD in adults.

Raymond Lam	Nature and Prevalence of Mental Illness in the Workplace	"[""Carolyn Dewa"", ""Alain Lesage"", ""Paula Goering"", ""Michele Caveen""]"	"This discussion paper explores the state of knowledge about the prevalence of mental illness and its effect on the working population. Major trends in the literature are also commented on, and significant gaps in knowledge are identified. Annually, 12% of Canadians from 15 to 64 years suffer from a mental disorder or substance dependence. Few studies have examined the prevalence of mental disorders among Canadian workers. Results from Ontario estimate that monthly, about 8% of the working population has a diagnosable mental disorder. Preliminary findings also indicate differences in the prevalence of mental disorders among workers with regard to occupation, age, sex, physical disorders, work environment and work-related stress. Studies indicate that mental and emotional health problems are associated with staggering social and economic costs, which create a heavy burden on the workplace. About one-third of society's depression-related productivity losses can be attributed to work disruptions. The impact of mental illness on the workplace has been examined in terms of its effect on presenteeism, absenteeism and disability days. The presence of any of these has been used to indicate decreased productivity, the largest burden arising from presenteeism. In total, Canada annually loses about $4.5 billion from this decreased productivity. Mental illness is also associated with short-term and long-term disability, which in turn is often related to insurance coverage. Mental illness related disability claims have doubled and mental illness accounts for 30% of disability claims, at a cost of $15 to $33 billion annually. The needs of the working population and employers must be addressed. We must be aware of patterns of mental disorder among occupational groups and industry sectors. In addition, we must understand how the disability benefit structure impacts the prevalence as well as patterns of disability related to mental illness. Effective policies and programs must be based on solid evidence."

Raymond Lam	Projections of Global Mortality and Burden of Disease from 2002 to 2030	"[""Colin D Mathers"", ""Dejan Loncar""]"	"BACKGROUND: Global and regional projections of mortality and burden of disease by cause for the years 2000, 2010, and 2030 were published by Murray and Lopez in 1996 as part of the Global Burden of Disease project. These projections, which are based on 1990 data, continue to be widely quoted, although they are substantially outdated; in particular, they substantially underestimated the spread of HIV/AIDS. To address the widespread demand for information on likely future trends in global health, and thereby to support international health policy and priority setting, we have prepared new projections of mortality and burden of disease to 2030 starting from World Health Organization estimates of mortality and burden of disease for 2002. This paper describes the methods, assumptions, input data, and results. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Relatively simple models were used to project future health trends under three scenarios--baseline, optimistic, and pessimistic--based largely on projections of economic and social development, and using the historically observed relationships of these with cause-specific mortality rates. Data inputs have been updated to take account of the greater availability of death registration data and the latest available projections for HIV/AIDS, income, human capital, tobacco smoking, body mass index, and other inputs. In all three scenarios there is a dramatic shift in the distribution of deaths from younger to older ages and from communicable, maternal, perinatal, and nutritional causes to noncommunicable disease causes. The risk of death for children younger than 5 y is projected to fall by nearly 50% in the baseline scenario between 2002 and 2030. The proportion of deaths due to noncommunicable disease is projected to rise from 59% in 2002 to 69% in 2030. Global HIV/AIDS deaths are projected to rise from 2.8 million in 2002 to 6.5 million in 2030 under the baseline scenario, which assumes coverage with antiretroviral drugs reaches 80% by 2012. Under the optimistic scenario, which also assumes increased prevention activity, HIV/AIDS deaths are projected to drop to 3.7 million in 2030. Total tobacco-attributable deaths are projected to rise from 5.4 million in 2005 to 6.4 million in 2015 and 8.3 million in 2030 under our baseline scenario. Tobacco is projected to kill 50% more people in 2015 than HIV/AIDS, and to be responsible for 10% of all deaths globally. The three leading causes of burden of disease in 2030 are projected to include HIV/AIDS, unipolar depressive disorders, and ischaemic heart disease in the baseline and pessimistic scenarios. Road traffic accidents are the fourth leading cause in the baseline scenario, and the third leading cause ahead of ischaemic heart disease in the optimistic scenario. Under the baseline scenario, HIV/AIDS becomes the leading cause of burden of disease in middle- and low-income countries by 2015. CONCLUSIONS: These projections represent a set of three visions of the future for population health, based on certain explicit assumptions. Despite the wide uncertainty ranges around future projections, they enable us to appreciate better the implications for health and health policy of currently observed trends, and the likely impact of fairly certain future trends, such as the ageing of the population, the continued spread of HIV/AIDS in many regions, and the continuation of the epidemiological transition in developing countries. The results depend strongly on the assumption that future mortality trends in poor countries will have a relationship to economic and social development similar to those that have occurred in the higher-income countries"	Depression is currently the fourth leading medical condition contributing to global burden of disease and is estimated to rise to second by the year 2030 #AUTHOR_TAG.

Current CTC assays, including the US Food and Drug Administration-cleared CellSearch(r) system, typically use markers [e.g., cytokeratins (CKs), the transmembrane protein EpCAM (epithelial cell adhesion molecule)] that are expressed on normal and malignant epithelial cells but not on the surrounding normal leukocytes.   METHODS We enrolled 53 patients with benign colon diseases (e.g., diverticulosis, benign polyps, Crohn disease, ulcerative rectocolitis, colonic endometriosis) and analyzed their peripheral blood with 2 previously validated CTC assays: the epithelial immunospot (EPISPOT) assay and the CellSearch system. The EPISPOT assay detects only viable, CK19-releasing CTCs that were enriched by depletion of CD45(+) leukocytes, whereas the CellSearch system detects CK-positive CTCs after positive EpCAM-based immunomagnetic enrichment.   RESULTS In patients with benign colon diseases, positive events that met the criteria for ""tumor cells"" were detected with both the CellSearch system (11.3%) and the CK19-EPISPOT assay (18.9%), whereas no positive events were detected in samples from healthy volunteers. Positive events were detected most frequently in patients with diverticulosis and Crohn disease. All positive events lacked expression of CD45, a common leukocyte antigen.   CONCLUSIONS These results indicate that patients with benign inflammatory colon diseases in particular can harbor viable circulating epithelial cells that are detectable with current CTC assays.

A control group consisted of 25 men with an increased prostate specific antigen and no tumor detected on extended prostate biopsy. Samples were analyzed for circulating tumor cells using the CellSearch System.Circulating tumor cells were detected in 21% of patients with cancer and 20% of controls (p = 0.946).

However, only approximately 30% of men with suspicion of cancer have it confirmed on prostate biopsy, and not all of these need treatment. Detection of circulating tumor cells in localized prostate cancer has given variable results, but it could be a useful complementary screening tool to detect prostate cancer in men with abnormal screening tests before the evaluation with prostate biopsy. To evaluate the diagnostic yield of the detection of mCPC as a complementary PC screening test in a population fulfilling criteria for a prostate biopsy for suspicion of PC.   METHODS A prospective screening study of consecutive patients aged 45-80 years presenting to the urologist for PC screening. Inclusion criteria were PSA >4.0 ng/ml, PSA velocity >0.35 ng/ml/year and/or DRE suspicious for cancer. Patients fulfilling inclusion criteria had blood taken for mCPC detection and then underwent 12-core transrectal prostate biopsy. Double immune-histochemical staining with anti-PSA and anti-P504S was used to detect mCPC. Both cytologist and pathologist were blinded to the results of the biopsy, mCPC results and clinical details. The diagnostic yield of the presence or absence of mCPC was evaluated; the prostate biopsy was classified as cancer or no -cancer.   RESULTS 228 men participated, with a mean age of 66.8 +- 8.8 years and a median serum PSA of 5.15 ng/ml. 28.6% of the biopsies were positive for PC, and mCPC were detected in 31.0%of all cases. Sensibility, specificity and negative predictive value were 86.2%, 90.8% and 94.3% respectively. The negative and positive like-lihood ratios were 9.36 and 0.15. In men with a PSA <4.0ngml, 13.3% had cancer detected on biopsy, with a sensibility and specificity for mCPC detection of 83.3% and 84.6% and negative predictive value of 97.1%.

Rubin""]"	"PROSTATE CANCER AFFECTS 1 OF 9 men older than 65 years and is a leading cause of cancerrelated death in men, second only to lung cancer. While the advent of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening has led to earlier detection of prostate cancer, the impact of PSA screening on cancer-specific mortality is unknown, pending the results of prospective randomized screening studies. A major limitation of the serum PSA test is a lack of prostate cancer sensitivity and specificity, especially in the intermediate range of PSA detection (4-10 ng/mL). Coincident with increased serum PSA testing, there has been a significant increase both in the number of prostate needle biopsies performed and in the number of equivocal prostate needle biopsy specimens. Thus, development of additional serum and tissue biomarkers to supplement PSA screening is needed. Molecular profiling establishes a new perspective in the study of cancer. Recent studies have suggested that it is possible to study cancer with a global perspective, taking advantage of DNA and protein microarrays as ""windows"" into the expressed human genome.

The aim of this study was to perform enhanced reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) mRNA to define the predictive value of PSA-positive circulating cells in a large series of patients.   METHODS The study included 46 patients with Stage T1 to T2 prostate cancer, 94 with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and 51 (including 9 women) with nonprostatic disease. PSA-positive cells from peripheral blood samples were detected by Southern blot analysis of the RT-PCR products. Original oligonucleotide primers were defined to exclusively detect the three PSA mRNA splices.   RESULTS Circulating PSA-positive cells were observed in 8 (8.5%) of 94 patients with BPH, 10 (22%) of 46 with Stage T1 to T2 prostate cancer, and 9 (17.6%) of 51 with nonprostatic disease. The detection rate of PSA-positive circulating cells was significantly increased in patients with prostate cancer versus patients with BPH (P = 0.03). Among clinically localized prostate cancers with a Gleason score less than 8, a correlation was observed between PSA-positive circulating cells and Stage pT3 cancer (P = 0.038), capsular penetration (P = 0.04), and a positive margin (P = 0.038). The specificity of the assay for Stage pT3 cancer detection was 84.6%, with a positive predictive value of 60%.   CONCLUSIONS Although RT-PCR assay may have a role in preoperative local staging, this study demonstrated the absence of tissue and tumor specificity of PSA-positive circulating cells, accounting for the weak positive predictive value of this technique."

We report a quantitative automated imaging system for analysis of prostate CTCs, taking advantage of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), a unique prostate tumor-associated marker. The specificity of PSA staining enabled optimization of criteria for baseline image intensity, morphometric measurements, and integration of multiple signals in a three-dimensional microfluidic device. In a pilot analysis, we detected CTCs in prostate cancer patients with localized disease, before surgical tumor removal in 8 of 19 (42%) patients (range, 38 to 222 CTCs per milliliter). For 6 of the 8 patients with preoperative CTCs, a precipitous postoperative decline (<24 hours) suggests a short half-life for CTCs in the blood circulation. Other patients had persistent CTCs for up to 3 months after prostate removal, suggesting early but transient disseminated tumor deposits. In patients with metastatic prostate cancer, CTCs were detected in 23 of 36 (64%) cases (range, 14 to 5000 CTCs per milliliter). In previously untreated patients followed longitudinally, the numbers of CTCs declined after the initiation of effective therapy. The prostate cancer-specific TMPRSS2-ERG fusion was detectable in RNA extracted from CTCs from 9 of 20 (45%) patients with metastatic disease, and dual staining of captured CTCs for PSA and the cell division marker Ki67 indicated a broad range for the proportion of proliferating cells among CTCs. This method for analysis of CTCs will facilitate the application of noninvasive tumor sampling to direct targeted therapies in advanced prostate cancer and warrants the initiation of long-term clinical studies to test the importance of CTCs in invasive localized disease."

In 1996, a European ISHAGE Working Group was founded to standardize and optimize procedures used for the detection of minimal residual disease. We have attempted to develop objective criteria for the evaluation of immunocytochemically identifiable cancer cells. Methods: An interlaboratory ring experiment was performed, to compare the screening and detection of micrometastasis-positive events between different laboratories. The discrepant results induced us to establish a common consensus on morphological criteria applicable to the identification of immunostained micrometastatic TC. Results: Bared on this consensus evaluation, we propose a classification of stained elements into three groups: (1) 'TC's show pathognomonic signs of epithelial TC-nature, as defined by a clearly enlarged nucleus or clusters of > or = 2 immunopositive cells. (2) 'Probable TC's represent morphological overlap between hematopoietic cells (HC) and TC which lack pathognomonic signs of TC-nature, but do not exhibit clear morphological features of HC. These cells are considered as TC if control staining with an isotype-specific, unrelated Ab is negative. (3) 'TC-negative' cells are defined as 'false positive' HC, skin squamous epithelial cells and artefacts.

Five of six (83%) specimens with invasive urothelial carcinoma had 2+ staining and one case had focal staining. We conclude that immunohistochemistry for P504S has potential utility in the diagnosis of prostate cancer, including those treated by hormones and radiation. Circumferential luminal to subluminal and diffuse cytoplasmic staining is the most specific staining pattern for prostatic carcinoma and is almost never associated with benign prostatic tissue. However, a negative P504S immunostain does not automatically rule out prostate cancer, as 18% of cases were negative. Additionally, occasional benign glands, high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, atypical adenomatous hyperplasia, and urothelial carcinoma may express P504S. Therefore, we think that P504S is best used only in conjunction with strict light microscopic correlation and preferably with high molecular weight cytokeratin immunostaining."

Recently, AMACR has been demonstrated to be over-expressed in localized and metastatic prostate cancer, suggesting that it may be an important tumor marker. This study examines AMACR expression in a variety of human cancers and their precursor lesions. A survey of online Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) and Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) databases revealed that AMACR was over-expressed in multiple cancers. The findings were confirmed by AMACR immunohistochemistry performed on several tissue microarrays containing common human tumors, including prostate, colon, and breast. Based on prior work, AMACR protein expression was divided into two categories: negative (negative to weak staining intensity) and positive (moderate to strong staining intensity). AMACR protein over-expression was found in a number of cancers, including colorectal, prostate, ovarian, breast, bladder, lung, and renal cell carcinomas, lymphoma, and melanoma. Greatest over-expression was seen in colorectal and prostate cancer with positive staining in 92% and 83% cases, respectively. AMACR over-expression was present in 44% of breast cancer cases. AMACR was also over-expressed in precursor lesions. Sixty-four percent of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and 75% colonic adenomas demonstrated positive AMACR protein expression. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for AMACR using laser capture microdissected prostate tissue confirmed gene over-expression at the mRNA level.

A micro-fluidic system, not limited to EpCAM or CK, was developed to use multiple antibodies for capture followed by detection using CEE-Enhanced (CE), a novel in situ staining method that fluorescently labels the capture antibodies bound to CTCs. Higher recovery of CTCs was demonstrated using antibody mixtures compared to anti-EpCAM. In addition, CK-positive breast cancer cells were found in 15 of 24 samples (63%; range 1-60 CTCs), while all samples contained additional CE-positive cells (range 1-41; median = 11; P = .02).

CellSearch was used to isolate EpCAM+ objects and to stain DNA, cytokeratin and CD45. All EpCAM+CK+ objects were subdivided into seven classes on the basis of predefined morphological appearance in 63 independent samples. Association of each class with survival was studied using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses.Each EpCAM+CK+CD45- class showed a strong association with overall survival (P < 0.001). This included small tumor microparticles (S-TMP), which did not require a nucleus and thus are unable to metastasize. A higher number of objects in any class was associated with decreased survival.

Chomsky""]"	"We investigate several conceptions of linguistic structure to determine whether or not they can provide simple and ""revealing"" grammars that generate all of the sentences of English and only these. We find that no finite-state Markov process that produces symbols with transition from state to state can serve as an English grammar. Furthermore, the particular subclass of such processes that produce n -order statistical approximations to English do not come closer, with increasing n , to matching the output of an English grammar. We formalize-the notions of ""phrase structure"" and show that this gives us a method for describing language which is essentially more powerful, though still representable as a rather elementary type of finite-state process. Nevertheless, it is successful only when limited to a small subset of simple sentences. We study the formal properties of a set of grammatical transformations that carry sentences with phrase structure into new sentences with derived phrase structure, showing that transformational grammars are processes of the same elementary type as phrase-structure grammars; that the grammar of English is materially simplified if phrase structure description is limited to a kernel of simple sentences from which all other sentences are constructed by repeated transformations; and that this view of linguistic structure gives a certain insight into the use and understanding of language."

For example in speech recognition, an acoustic model trained for one language can be used to recognize speech in another language, with little or no re-training data. Transfer learning is closely related to multi-task learning (cross-lingual vs. multilingual), and is traditionally studied in the name of `model adaptation'. Recent advance in deep learning shows that transfer learning becomes much easier and more effective with high-level abstract features learned by deep models, and the `transfer' can be conducted not only between data distributions and data types, but also between model structures (e.g., shallow nets and deep nets) or even model types (e.g., Bayesian models and neural models). This review paper summarizes some recent prominent research towards this direction, particularly for speech and language processing.

Keller""]"	"Individual performers in ensembles must attend simultaneously to their own part and parts played by others. Thus, they allocate attentional resources skilfully and flexibly between different sound sources in order to (a) monitor their own part and other parts, and (b) group together elements from these parts to derive the whole ensemble texture. The theory of Attentional Resource Allocation in Musical Ensemble Performance (ARAMEP) presented here accounts for how attentional flexibility is influenced by various musical and extramusical factors. It is claimed that these factors act directly upon cognitive/motor mechanisms that regulate attentional resource allocation. Particular focus is given to the role of meter in modulating resources in a manner that is plastic and efficient, and hence conducive to optimal attentional flexibility. Specifically, metric frameworks enable the availability of resources to be varied systematically, so as to compensate for fluctuations in resource activity that arise due to variability in the concentration of events at different metric locations in the music."

The book addresses whether the creative scientist or artist is someone who would have been creative had he or she pursued any field. It is argued that this book accomplishes its three purposes: creativity is defined; creative persons are described and characterized; and the specificity-generality issue is discussed. However, the reviewers are disappointed that major areas of creativity training were not mentioned. A few authors (Runco, Singer) address educational implications, but there is too little of this. There are decades of experimental and correlational research dealing with efforts to promote creative thinking and problem solving in adults and children, in schools, businesses, and in human service and research industries (Parnes, 1992). We have organizations and societies devoted specifically to this purpose, such as the American Creativity Association, the Creative Education Foundation, The Center for Creative Learning, Inc., the Center for Studies in Creativity, The Center for Applied Research in Creativity, Northwood University's Alden Dow Creativity Center, The Center for Creative Leadership, and The National Association of Gifted Children.

The causes of this interference and its implications for the nature of attentional limitations have been controversial for 40 years, but recent experimental findings are beginning to provide some answers. Studies of the psychological refractory period effect indicate a stubborn bottleneck encompassing the process of choosing actions and probably memory retrieval generally, together with certain other cognitive operations. Other limitations associated with task preparation, sensory-perceptual processes, and timing can generate additional and distinct forms of interference. These conclusions challenge widely accepted ideas about attentional resources and probe reaction time methodologies.

Our main sources for thinking about generic structure at the time were Mitchell (195711975), the classic Firthian study of buying and selling in a Moroccan marketplace, and Hasan (1977), a seminal SFL paper that focussed on appointment making. Our aim was to develop a social model of genre that generalized across these and other text types (Christie & Martin, 1997; Eggins & Martin, 1997; Martin, 1985/ 1989, 1992; Ventola, 1987), and we appreciated having L&W's work to draw on. Over the years, their work had a continuing influence on the development of this model, especially with respect to two strands of the research. One strand was community based and oriented to mapping the repertoire of genres through which people enact their lives. Plurn (1988, in prcss) in particular was inrigued by the possibility of developing a sociolinguistic interview that was specifically designed to ""elicit"" genres, including nanatives. The other strand was school based (Rothery, 1990) and concerned with mapping the repertoire of genres used by students to succeed in school and to redrstribute control of these to students who were not accessing them (Hasan & Williams, 1985/1996; Martin, 1993). Here we were concerned with deconstructing the kinds of narrative students were expected to write and critique (Rothery & Macken, l99l).

Andr\u00e9""]"	"In closed systems, the O2) compensation point (G0) was previously defined as the upper limit of O2 level, at a given CO2 level, above which plants cannot have positive carbon balance and survive. Studies with 18O2 measure the actual O2 uptake by photorespiration due to the dual function of Rubisco, the enzyme that fixes CO2 and takes O2 as an alternative substrate. One-step modelling of CO2 and O2 uptakes allows calculating a plant specificity factor (Sp) as the sum of the biochemical specificity of Rubisco and a biophysical specificity, function of the resistance to CO2 transfer from the atmosphere to Rubisco. The crossing points (Cx, Ox) are defined as CO2 and O2 concentrations for which O2 and CO2 uptakes are equal. It is observed that: (1) under the preindustrial atmosphere, photorespiration of C3 plants uses as much photochemical energy as photosynthesis, i.e. the Cx and Ox are equal or near the CO2 and O2 concentrations of that epoch; (2) contrarily to G(C), a G0 does not practically limit the plant growth, i.e. the plant net CO2 balance is positive up to very high O2 levels; (3) however, in a closed biosystem, G0 exists; it is not the limit of plant growth, but the equilibrium point between photosynthesis and the opposite respiratory processes; (4) a reciprocal relationship exists between G0 and G(C), as unique functions of the respective CO2 and O2 concentrations and of Sp, this invalidates some results showing two different functions for G0 and G(C), and, consequently, the associated analyses related to greenhouse effects in the past; (5) the pre-industrial atmosphere levels of O2 and CO2 are the G0 and G(C) of the global bio-system. They are equal to or near the values of Cx and Ox of C3 plants, the majority of land plants in preindustrial period. We assume that the crossing points represent favourable feedback conditions for the biosphere-atmosphere equilibrium and could result from co-evolution of plants-atmosphere-climate. We suggest that the evolution of Rubisco and associated pathways is directed by an optimisation between photosynthesis and photorespiration."

Ellen R Nisbet""]"	"Rubisco I's specificity, which today may be almost perfectly tuned to the task of cultivating the global garden, controlled the balance of carbon gases and O(2) in the Precambrian ocean and hence, by equilibration, in the air. Control of CO(2) and O(2) by rubisco I, coupled with CH(4) from methanogens, has for the past 2.9 Ga directed the global greenhouse warming, which maintains liquid oceans and sustains microbial ecology.Both rubisco compensation controls and the danger of greenhouse runaway (e.g. glaciation) put limits on biological productivity. Rubisco may sustain the air in either of two permissible stable states: either an anoxic system with greenhouse warming supported by both high methane mixing ratios as well as carbon dioxide, or an oxygen-rich system in which CO(2) largely fulfils the role of managing greenhouse gas, and in which methane is necessarily only a trace greenhouse gas, as is N(2)O. Transition from the anoxic to the oxic state risks glaciation. CO(2) build-up during a global snowball may be an essential precursor to a CO(2)-dominated greenhouse with high levels of atmospheric O(2). Photosynthetic and greenhouse-controlling competitions between marine algae, cyanobacteria, and terrestrial C3 and C4 plants may collectively set the CO(2) : O(2) ratio of the modern atmosphere (last few million years ago in a mainly glacial epoch), maximizing the productivity close to rubisco compensation and glacial limits."

CCT966	186961244	Wind regimes and their relation to synoptic variables using self-organizing maps	Sigalit Berkovic	Easterly Wind Storms over Israel	"[""H. Saaroni"", ""B. Ziv"", ""A. Bitan"", ""P. Alpert""]"	"Continental wind storms are common along the Mediterranean coast. Along the northern coast they are mostly cold, similar to the Bora or the Mistral, and along the southern coast they are mostly warm, e.g., the Ghibli or the Shirocco. At the eastern Mediterranean basin and the Levant region, these storms are intermittently warm and cold during the same season and often even during the same event. Quasi-stationary systems, as well as moving disturbances, are the cause of such wind storms. Accordingly, the resulting weather conditions may be extremely converse due to the characteristics of the advected airmass. Specific regions in Israel, sensitive to easterly storms, are influenced by these wind storms for about 10% of the year (e.g., the westerly slopes of the mountains and valleys with west-east orientation). The frequency, however, of widespread storms covering the entire region is only approximately 1.4% of the entire year. These wind storms are therefore classified in the present study according to their climatological and synoptic characteristics; indicating that the dominant synoptic situation is the Red-Sea trough and the warm advections. These storms appear only from October-May and are most frequent during the cold season. The diurnal course is characterized by a strengthening in the morning hours and a weakening at noon and in the afternoon hours, due to the opposing effect of the westerly sea breeze, suppressing the easterly winds and the effect of katabatic winds. Nevertheless, synoptic conditions may contribute to this tendency as well. Accordingly, a significant increase in the frequencies of easterly storms, in relation to distance from the seashore has been identified. Although most of the stormy days are with westerly winds, the easterly wind storms has vast environmental implications, creating damage especially to agriculture and occasionally also to property and life; coastal flooding, potential air pollution, intensifying of forest fires and occasionally dust and sand storms."

S. Kritzberg"", ""S. M. Ekstr\u00f6m""]"	"Increased color in surface waters, or browning, can alter lake ecological function, lake thermal stratification and pose difficulties for drinking water treatment. Mechanisms suggested to cause browning include increased dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and iron concentrations, as well as a shift to more colored DOC. While browning of surface waters is widespread and well documented, little is known about why some lakes resist it. Here, we present a comprehensive study of Malaren, the third largest lake in Sweden. In Malaren, the vast majority of water and DOC enters a western lake basin, and after approximately 2.8 years, drains from an eastern basin. Despite 40 years of increased terrestrial inputs of colored substances to western lake basins, the eastern basin has resisted browning over this time period. Here we find the half-life of iron was far shorter (0.6 years) than colored organic matter (A420; 1.7 years) and DOC as a whole (6.1 years). We found changes in filtered iron concentrations relate strongly to the observed loss of color in the western basins. In addition, we observed a substantial shift from colored DOC of terrestrial origin, to less colored autochthonous sources, with a substantial decrease in aromaticity (-17%) across the lake. We suggest that rapid losses of iron and colored DOC caused the limited browning observed in eastern lake basins. Across a wider dataset of 69 Swedish lakes, we observed greatest browning in acidic lakes with shorter retention times (< 1.5 years). These findings suggest that water residence time, along with iron, pH and colored DOC may be of central importance when modeling and projecting changes in brownification on broader spatial scales."

A common view is that upstream lakes might prolong the water retention in the landscape, resulting in an altered OC character downstream. We calculated the number of lakes upstream for 24,742 Swedish lakes in seven river basins spanning from 56o to 68o N. For each of these lakes, we used a lake volume to discharge comparison on a landscape scale to account for upstream water retention by lakes (Tn tot). We found a surprisingly weak relationship between the number of lakes upstream and Tn tot. Accordingly, we found that the coloured fraction of organic carbon was not related to lake landscape position but significantly related to Tn tot when we analysed lake water chemical data from 1,559 lakes in the studied river basins. Thus, we conclude that water renewal along the aquatic continuum by lateral water inputs offsets cumulative retention by lakes. Based on our findings, we suggest integrating Tn tot in studies that address lake landscape position in the boreal zone to better understand variations in the character of organic carbon across lake districts."

CCT975	186960882	The regulation of the air: a hypothesis	E Nisbet	"Despite slow catalysis and confused substrate specificity, all ribulose bisphosphate carboxylases may be nearly perfectly optimized"	"[""G. G. B. Tcherkez"", ""G. D. Farquhar"", ""T. J. Andrews""]"	"The cornerstone of autotrophy, the CO(2)-fixing enzyme, d-ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), is hamstrung by slow catalysis and confusion between CO(2) and O(2) as substrates, an ""abominably perplexing"" puzzle, in Darwin's parlance. Here we argue that these characteristics stem from difficulty in binding the featureless CO(2) molecule, which forces specificity for the gaseous substrate to be determined largely or completely in the transition state. We hypothesize that natural selection for greater CO(2)/O(2) specificity, in response to reducing atmospheric CO(2):O(2) ratios, has resulted in a transition state for CO(2) addition in which the CO(2) moiety closely resembles a carboxylate group. This maximizes the structural difference between the transition states for carboxylation and the competing oxygenation, allowing better differentiation between them. However, increasing structural similarity between the carboxylation transition state and its carboxyketone product exposes the carboxyketone to the strong binding required to stabilize the transition state and causes the carboxyketone intermediate to bind so tightly that its cleavage to products is slowed. We assert that all Rubiscos may be nearly perfectly adapted to the differing CO(2), O(2), and thermal conditions in their subcellular environments, optimizing this compromise between CO(2)/O(2) specificity and the maximum rate of catalytic turnover. Our hypothesis explains the feeble rate enhancement displayed by Rubisco in processing the exogenously supplied carboxyketone intermediate, compared with its nonenzymatic hydrolysis, and the positive correlation between CO(2)/O(2) specificity and (12)C/(13)C fractionation. It further predicts that, because a more product-like transition state is more ordered (decreased entropy), the effectiveness of this strategy will deteriorate with increasing temperature."

It has been inferred that the greenhouse effect of atmospheric CO(2) and/or CH(4) compensated for the lower solar luminosity and dictated an Archaean climate in which liquid water was stable in the hydrosphere. Here we demonstrate, however, that the mineralogy of Archaean sediments, particularly the ubiquitous presence of mixed-valence Fe(II-III) oxides (magnetite) in banded iron formations is inconsistent with such high concentrations of greenhouse gases and the metabolic constraints of extant methanogens. Prompted by this, and the absence of geologic evidence for very high greenhouse-gas concentrations, we hypothesize that a lower albedo on the Earth, owing to considerably less continental area and to the lack of biologically induced cloud condensation nuclei, made an important contribution to moderating surface temperature in the Archaean eon. Our model calculations suggest that the lower albedo of the early Earth provided environmental conditions above the freezing point of water, thus alleviating the need for extreme greenhouse-gas concentrations to satisfy the faint early Sun paradox."

After an initial hot period, surface temperatures in the late Hadean may have been clement beneath an atmosphere containing greenhouse gases over an ocean-dominated planetary surface. The first crust was mafic and it internally melted repeatedly to produce the felsic rocks that crystallized the Jack Hills zircons. This crust was destabilized during late heavy bombardment. Plate tectonics probably started soon after and had produced voluminous continental crust by the mid Archean, but ocean volumes were sufficient to submerge much of this crust. In the Hadean and early Archean, hydrothermal systems around abundant komatiitic volcanism may have provided suitable sites to host the earliest living communities and for the evolution of key enzymes. Evidence from the Isua Belt, Greenland, suggests life was present by 3.8 Gya, and by the mid-Archean, the geological record both in the Pilbara in Western Australia and the Barberton Greenstone Belt in South Africa shows that microbial life was abundant, probably using anoxygenic photosynthesis.

In the article, the author also speaks to the critical importance of continuing to ground the profession in art and science. Implications for the future of humanism and counseling are presented. Keywords: humanism, counseling, art, science, diversity ********** Consistent with his previous work, Hansen (2012) offers a timely and thought-provoking analysis of the past and present of humanism as well as recommendations for the future of counseling. It is with great respect and appreciation for Hansen's work as well as our shared commitments to humanistic counseling and counseling as a profession that I offer the following response. In this article, I offer support for Hansen's overall position that humanism has provided a foundational framework for the present and future of professional counseling. Second, I counter Hansen's position that the counseling profession has and ideally ought to be grounded solely in the humanities. In so doing, I provide evidence that humanism was founded as both an art and a science (Maslow, 1968; Rogers, 1951) and discuss some of the ways that this dual foundation is consistent with ethical (e.g., American Counseling Association [ACA], 2005, C.6.e.) and effective practice in counseling. Third and last, I provide a further extension of Hansen's vision for the future of counseling, a vision that encompasses renewed respect for human complexity, multiple perspectives, and the optimal development of human potential. It is my hope that this extension of Hansen's vision will ensure the continued growth and relevance of professional counseling and related humanistically oriented fields. HUMANISM: THE FOUNDATION OF PROFESSIONAL COUNSELING AND RELATED FIELDS As Hansen points out, numerous people and movements have been credited with the founding of counseling as a profession. Although Frank Parsons and early advocates for educational and career development are often credited with influencing the foundation of the diverse field of counseling (Brown & Trusty, 2005), historically, theoretically, and practically, Sigmund Freud and colleagues' psychoanalytic/psychodynamic theory is more often considered the first force in counseling and psychology. B. F. Skinner and colleagues' behaviorism, having developed later, which is similarly referred to as the second force (Ivey, D'Andrea, & Ivey, 2011), also influenced counseling and related fields. Yet, as Hansen (2012) notes, professional counseling is founded on humanism, the third force in counseling and psychology. This section provides additional context for understanding the historical, theoretical, and empirical association between humanism and counseling. Like its antecedents, humanistic counseling developed in a historical and sociopolitical context that is continuing to evolve. Furthermore, according to Rogers (1951), humanism and humanistic counseling and psychology did not reject but rather built on and expanded the theoretical and empirical contributions made by their predecessors, providing a deep foundation for current practice and future growth. Humanistically oriented counselors consider people's strengths and possibilities, recognizing that all people have the capacity to develop, to grow, to heal, and to maximize their own potential, that is, to ""actualize"" (Raskin & Rogers, 1995, p. 128). Overall, humanists are interested in normal and optimal functioning as well as people's phenomenological subjective experience (Kirschenbaum, 2007). Humanistic counseling, then, is a holistic approach that emphasizes healthy human development, human strengths and wellness, and understanding people in their environmental contexts (Lundin, 1996). Using a variety of creative approaches centered on the counselor's attitude toward the client (Rogers, 1951), humanistically oriented counselors partner with clients, often attending to Rogers's (1957) ""necessary and sufficient conditions"" (p. ..."

HANSEN""]"	"Founding humanists argued that counseling should be ideologically grounded in the humanities. Currently, professional counseling culture is largely structured by scientific assumptions, which, the author maintains, have had a detrimental impact on the profession. Specific recommendations for shifting professional counseling culture to a humanities foundation are offered. ********** The counseling profession has a fascinating history. Part of the allure of this history is the various, and often conflictual, accounts of the counseling process and human nature that have been proposed. From the Freudian view that people are basically sexual animals (Freud, 1905/1958), to the Rogerian vision of human strength and self-actualization (Rogers, 1951), and to the computer programming models of the cognitive behaviorists (Beck, 1976), counselors have been witness to an awe-inspiring parade of ideas about how to bring about human change. One controversial theme that has run through these ideas is whether the counseling process should be fundamentally conceptualized as art or science (Hofmann & Weinberger, 2007). Orthodox behaviorists, for example, argued that counseling should be a strictly scientific enterprise (Skinner, 1974), whereas founding humanists alternatively proposed that counseling should be informed by the humanities, not the reductive forces of science (Maslow, 1968; Matson, 1971; Rogers, 1951). At this point in history, most practitioners would probably agree that the counseling process should be conceptualized along both artistic and scientific lines (Hofmann & Weinberger, 2007). This ideological compromise is a functional and adaptive one for counselors to adopt. Arguably, counseling should be composed of a mixture of relational intuition and scientific accountability. However, at a conceptual level, this compromise prevents each of the ideologies from reaching its full visionary potential, as the image offered by the humanities or arts is kept in check by science, and the scientific vision, likewise, is tamed by the humanities. As an analogy, mixing two colors might produce a visually appealing result; however, because the colors are mixed, the full aesthetic potential of each of the individual colors is lost. Notably, though ideologically pure, sweeping visions of counseling processes and the helping professions have occasionally been offered at various points in social science history. Watson's (1919) proposal that humans are blank slates on which behaviorists could write, Skinner's (1976) vision of a utopia founded on the principles of learning, and existentialist conceptions of the importance of human freedom and subjective experience (May, Angel, Ellenberger, 1958) were arguably breakthrough attempts to articulate relatively pure visions of scientific- and humanities-based counseling ideologies. The extraordinary insights gained from these visions were eventually critiqued and assimilated back into the diluted science/ humanities ideological mixture. During the past 2 decades, however, advocates for a scientific vision of counseling have once again begun to break out of this long-standing mixture and have articulated a vision of the helping professions grounded in pure science, unencumbered by insights from the humanities. The empirical supported treatment (EST) movement (Task Force on Promotion and Dissemination of Psychological Procedures, 1995), best practices conceptualizations of counseling processes (Hansen, 2006c; McGowan, 2003), and the position that EST training should be a required part of educational curricula in the helping professions (e.g., Task Force on Promotion and Dissemination of Psychological Procedures, 1995), for instance, all draw from a vision of counseling that is akin to medicine or engineering rather than literature or art. Notably, then, scientifically minded social scientists have not restricted their vision to the counseling process; they have advocated that multiple aspects of helping professions (i. ..."

Both maps and tables are used to support the analysis. The diffusionist theory is reviewed and applied to the understanding of open access. Findings The paper discovers that technology is not the only factor determining the diffusion pattern of information systems as discussed in the literature. Cultural dissimilarities across countries have played a significant role in open access development. Open access can only be effectively established after it meets local standards Practical implications The findings help understanding of why open access has a disproportionate growth among developing countries, and even among developed countries, where the ICT infrastructure has been in place. Originality/value Few studies have taken a transnational view to analyze open access geography at the global level, and few have been able to synthesize models to interpret diverse discoveries.

Theintroductionofself-adaptationandself-management techniques in a service-oriented system can allow to meet in a changing environment the levels of service formally defined with the system users in a Service Level Agreement (SLA). However, a self-adaptive SOA system has to be carefully designed in order not to compromise the system scalability and availability. In this paper we present the design and performance evaluation of a brokering service that supports at runtime the self-adaptation of composite services offered to several concurrent users with different service levels. To evaluate theperformance of the brokering service, we have carried out an extensive set of experiments on different implementations of the system architecture using workload generators that are based on open and closed system models. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the brokering service design in achieving scalability and high availability."

Demonstrating this phenonemon is hampered by the difficulty of isolating the effects of time since population divergence vs. gene flow on levels of molecular genetic differentiation. For example, weak genetic differentiation between taxa could be due to recent divergence, gene flow, or a combination of these factors. Nonetheless, a number of convincing examples of speciation with gene flow have recently emerged, owing in part to the development of new analytical methods designed to estimate gene flow specifically. A recent example of speciation with gene flow in salamanders (Niemiller et al. 2008) further advances our understanding of this phenonemon, by showing that gene flow between cave and spring salamanders was ongoing during speciation, rather than having occurred after a long period of allopatric divergence. Future work on the ecological and genetic factors reducing gene flow will likely increase our understanding of the conditions that faciliate divergence in the face of gene flow."

Farooqui"", ""Hsiu-Chiung Yang"", ""Thad A. Rosenberger"", ""Lloyd A. Horrocks""]"	"Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) is the name for the class of lipolytic enzymes that hydrolyze the acyl group from the sn-2 position of glycerophospholipids, generating free fatty acids and lysophospholipids. The products of the PLA2-catalyzed reaction can potentially act as second messengers themselves, or be further metabolized to eicosanoids, platelet-activating factor, and lysophosphatidic acid. All of these are recognized as bioactive lipids that can potentially alter many ongoing cellular processes. The presence of PLA2 in the central nervous system, accompanied by the relatively large quantity of potential substrate, poses an interesting dilemma as to the role PLA2 has during both physiologic and pathologic states. Several different PLA2 enzymes exist in brain, some of which have been partially characterized. They are classified into two subtypes, CA2+-dependent and Ca2+-independent, based on their catalytic dependence on Ca2+. Under physiologic conditions, PLA2 may be involved in phospholipid turnover, membrane remodeling, exocytosis, detoxification of phospholipid peroxides, and neurotransmitter release. However, under pathological situations, increased PLA2 activity may result in the loss of essential membrane glycerophospholipids, resulting in altered membrane permeability, ion homeostasis, increased free fatty acid release, and the accumulation of lipid peroxides. These processes, along with loss of ATP, may be responsible for the loss of membrane phospholipid and subsequent neuronal injury found in ischemia, spinal cord injury, and other neurodegenerative diseases. This review outlines the current knowledge of the PLA2 found in the central nervous system and attempts to define the role of PLA2 during both physiologic and pathologic conditions."

Grain size exerts some influence on REE composition, as demonstrated by the higher REE contents of clay minerals in sediments from both rivers. Heavy minerals contribute about 10^20% of the total REE in the sediments. Apatite is rare in the river sediments, and contributes less than 2% of the REE content, but other heavy minerals such as sphene, allanite and zircon are important reservoirs of residual REE fractions.

Sediment pollution assessment was carried out using contamination factor (CF), pollution load index (PLI), enrichment factor (EF) and geoaccumulation index (Igeo). The metal concentrations in the assessed sediment samples (Geli Stream and sandbar) were compared with consensus-based TEC and PEC values. The CF values for As, Cu, Ni, Co and Cr N10 in sediments in the Geli Stream denote very high contamination by these metals. The PLI value indicated that the Geli Stream was moderately polluted. The highest Igeo values of Sb and Cr were found to be extremely polluted in sediments. The highest EF values of Sb, As and Cr were above 50, indicating extremely severe enrichment. Ecotoxicological indices (SQG) were used to assess the contamination levels of surface sediments. In this study, As and Cu in stream sediments were determined to be heavily polluted (37.95 ppm and 85.12 ppm; and Cr moderately polluted (64.50 ppm).

Similar methods have even allowed a patient who was assumed to be in a vegetative state to communicate. PET has provided insights into similarities and differences in the ways in which pain is processed by this patient group, whereas electrophysiological methods have revealed further evidence of awareness as well as learning.The prognostic and diagnostic information provided by these new approaches clearly argues for their future use alongside conventional assessment techniques. By demonstrating that a behaviourally unresponsive patient could communicate by means of his/her thoughts using functional MRI, these new techniques open up a new direction of research into the development of more sophisticated communication devices that may be used more generally by these patients.

This study analyzes data on patients transferred from their initial modality at the University Hospital Gent between 1978 and 1996 for the reasons for, and outcomes from, the transfer. The reasons for the transfer from HD to PD (n = 35) were access problems (25%), cardiovascular (40%) and blood pressure problems (25%), and personal choice (10%). For the transfer from PD to HD (n = 32) peritonitis (50%), social problems (14%), adequacy or ultrafiltration problems (25%), and leakage (11%) were the reasons. There were no differences in survivals between patients who started on HD and who were transferred to PD, and those who remained on HD (P = 0.4). There were improved survivals for the patients who started on PD and who were transferred to HD compared to those remaining on PD (P = 0.01). It is concluded that transferring problematic HD patients to PD does not improve their survivals, whereas the survival of patients with PD-related complications is improved by transferring them to HD. This is due to the differences in the reasons for transfer, which are PD-related complications in the case of PD patients, and cardiovascular problems in the case of HD patients."

Currie"", ""Emily S. Sena"", ""Sabrina Ramnarine"", ""Robin Grant"", ""Malcolm R. MacLeod"", ""Leslie A. Colvin"", ""Marie Fallon""]"	"Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a disabling pain condition resulting from chemotherapy for cancer. Severe acute CIPN may require chemotherapy dose reduction or cessation. There is no effective CIPN prevention strategy; treatment of established chronic CIPN is limited, and the prevalence of CIPN is not known. Here we used a systematic review to identify studies reporting the prevalence of CIPN. We searched Embase, Medline, CAB Abstracts, CINAHL, PubMed central, Cochrane Library, and Web of Knowledge for relevant references and used random-effects meta-regression to estimate overall prevalence. We assessed study quality using the CONSORT and STROBE guidelines, and we report findings according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidance. We provide a qualitative summary of factors reported to alter the risk of CIPN. We included 31 studies with data from 4179 patients in our analysis. CIPN prevalence was 68.1% (57.7-78.4) when measured in the first month after chemotherapy, 60.0% (36.4-81.6) at 3months and 30.0% (6.4-53.5) at 6months or more. Different chemotherapy drugs were associated with differences in CIPN prevalence, and there was some evidence of publication bias. Genetic risk factors were reported in 4 studies. Clinical risk factors, identified in 4 of 31 studies, included neuropathy at baseline, smoking, abnormal creatinine clearance, and specific sensory changes during chemotherapy. Although CIPN prevalence decreases with time, at 6months 30% of patients continue to suffer from CIPN. Routine CIPN surveillance during post-chemotherapy follow-up is needed. A number of genetic and clinical risk factors were identified that require further study. Copyright (c) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Participants were 91 colorectal cancer patients treated with OXA-based chemotherapy. Neurological assessment, clinical Total Neuropathy Score(c) (TNSc(c)) and nerve conduction studies were performed at baseline (T0), the end of chemotherapy (T1) and 2 years (T2) after discontinuation of chemotherapy. A total of 73 of 91 (80%) patients experienced OXAIPN at T1. At a median follow-up of 25 months, persistence of chronic OXAIPN was present in 61 of 73 patients (84%) and complete resolution was present in 12 patients (17%). Longitudinal comparison of TNSc(c) values between T1 and T2 revealed that the overall severity of OXAIPN in those 61 patients significantly decreased over time. Median TNSc(c) values were nine (range: 2-15) at T1 vs. four (range: 2-12) at T2 (P < 0.001). Likewise, sensory nerve conduction measures at T2 significantly improved in all sensory nerves tested, compared with T1. Severity of OXAIPN at T2 was significantly associated (P < 0.001) with high severity of OXAIPN at T1. In conclusion, persistence of OXAIPN beyond 2 years after finishing chemotherapy is common. Clinical and neurophysiological improvement is observed, although recovery is often incomplete.(c) 2015 Peripheral Nerve Society."

The improvement in survival for patients with early-stage colorectal cancer treated with oxaliplatin has highlighted the need for valid and reliable assessment of peripheral neuropathy.The objective of this paper was to explore neuropathic symptoms in oxaliplatin-treated patients as assessed using different methods.Consecutive symptomatic patients reporting peripheral neuropathy after oxaliplatin chemotherapy for colorectal cancer were interviewed using a semi-structured clinical interview. Neurotoxicity was also assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria scale (clinician-rated), patient 'self-report' questionnaires (PNQ), nerve conduction and clinical assessment.Twenty patients were assessed, 12.6 +- 2.8 months after treatment cessation (mean cumulative oxaliplatin dose, 789 mg/m(2)). In 40% of patients, neurotoxicity necessitated early cessation of treatment. Only 10% of patients were designated by clinicians with severe neurotoxicity, whilst, in contrast, patient interviews and self-report questionnaires described significant physical limitations due to neuropathic symptoms in 60% of patients. The majority (85%) of patients had objective evidence of sensory neuropathy with nerve conduction studies. Reports from clinical interviews were strongly correlated with patient self-assessment (Pearson coefficient = 0.790, p < 0.0005).Given the discrepancies in symptom prevalence highlighted by these findings, the monitoring of oxaliplatin-induced neurotoxicity would benefit from more informative clinical assessment, with inclusion of patient-reported outcome measures. Such an approach would be beneficial in a clinical trial setting to monitor the efficacy of interventions and in prospective studies of survivorship to determine the true burden of peripheral neuropathy in oxaliplatin-treated patients."

Articles were published between January 2004 and April 2015.A significant proportion of CRC survivors experience clinically meaningful levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms or reduced mental well-being across the trajectory of the illness. Demographic, medical, and psychosocial predictors of mental health outcomes were identified. However, few studies were theory-driven, and gaps remain in our understanding of risk and protective factors with respect to mental health outcomes, especially during long-term CRC survivorship.Theory-driven longitudinal research with larger samples is required to identify subgroups of CRC survivors with different trajectories of psychological adjustment. Such research would assess adjustment as a function of internal resources (e.g., personality and coping) and external resources (e.g., finances and social support) to inform future interventions for CRC survivors.
